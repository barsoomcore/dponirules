<h1>NINJA GEAR</h1>

<p>The following types of items can only be made by characters with the <a href="Skills.php?Name=Craft">Craft</a> (ninja gear) subskill. Ordinarily no ninja clan will supply anyone who is not a clan member with these sorts of items.</p>

<p>Ninja who wish to acquire these items must provide their clan with sufficient proof of their worth; ordinarily, this done by making the appropriate <a href="EquipmentWealth.php">Wealth</a> check, which in this case serves to simulate the necessary "donations" and support provided to the clan by the character.</p>

<h2>Gear Descriptions</h2>
<p><b>Ashiaro:</b> These wooden items are carefully-carved strap-on soles that cause the ninja's tracks to appear innocous -- tracks left by animals or children or any other non-ninja-looking creature. Wearing ashiaro imposes a penalty of -4 on the wearer's <a href="Skills.php?Name=Stealth">Stealth</a> or <a href="Skills.php?Name=Acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> checks, and reduces their speed by 10 feet per round, but also increases the  <a href="Skills.php?Name=Survival">Survival</a> Difficulty for anyone trying to follow the ninja's tracks by 5.</p>
<p><b>Caltrops:</b> A caltrop is a four-pronged iron spike crafted so that one prong faces up no matter how the caltrop comes to rest. You scatter caltrops on the ground in the hope that your enemies step on them or are at least forced to slow down to avoid them. One 2- pound bag of caltrops covers an area 5 feet square.</p>
<p>Each time a creature moves into an area covered by caltrops (or spends a round fighting while standing in such an area), it might step on one. The caltrops make an attack roll at +0 against the creature's <a href="Combat.php#Dodge">Dodge</a> (caltrops cannot be <a href="Combat.php#Parry">Parried</a>). If the caltrops succeed on the attack, the creature has stepped on one. The caltrop's damage bonus is +0. If the target fails its Toughness save, in addition to taking damage, its speed is reduced by one-half because its foot is injured. The injured creature can make a Recovery check to recover from the movement penalty once per day.</p>
<p>A charging or running creature must immediately stop if it steps on a caltrop. Any creature moving at half speed or slower can pick its way through a bed of caltrops with no trouble.</p>
<p>Caltrops may not be effective against unusual opponents.</p>
<p><b>Disguise Kit:</b> The ninja clans that specialize in disguise and intrigue have learned how to maximise the usefulness of their disguise tools. These kits not only contain makeup and useful props for almost any situation, they provide multi-use items, prosthetics and quick-change clothes to allow for such rapid transformations that observers will hardly believe it is the same person.</p>
<p>These kits supply a +2 bonus to all <a href="Skills.php?Name=Disguise">Disguise</a> checks. In addition, the Quick Change challenge can be performed without penalty by the owner of such a kit.</p>
<p><b>Doka:</b> A specially-insulated bag, a doka can carry live coals without risk of burning the one holding it. Coals will continue to burn in a doka for up to six hours. Such coals can be used to start fires, fight off the effects of cold, or as weapons, hurled at oncoming foes.</p>
<p><b><a href="EquipmentWeapons.php?Name=Kasayari">Kasayari</a>:</b> This weapon is included here because a character with <a href="Skills.php?Name=Craft">Craft</a> (ninja gear) can make one.</p>
<p><b>Metal Grips:</b> Strapped to the feet and hands, these metal bands set with raised studs provide increased stability on uncertain terrain. A user with Metal Grips gains a +2 bonus on <a href="Skills.php?Name=Climb">Climb</a> checks, and on <a href="Skills.php?Name=Acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> checks made to maintain balance.</p>
<p><b><a href="EquipmentWeapons.php?Name=Metsubishi">Metsubishi</a>:</b> This weapon is included here because a character with <a href="Skills.php?Name=Craft">Craft</a> (ninja gear) can make one.</p>
<p><b>Shikoro:</b> A hand-held saw that can be used to drill holes in walls, a shikoro is useful for getting a look inside a sealed room. A <a href="Skills.php?Name=Stealth">Stealth</a> check is required to use a shikoro quietly -- the <a href="Skills.php?Name=Stealth">Stealth</a> check is opposed by any potential listeners' <a href="Skills.php?Name=Notice">Notice</a> check, with a +10 bonus to the <a href="Skills.php?Name=Stealth">Stealth</a> check due to the shikoro's careful design. A viewhole created by a shikoro is not normally visible to anything other than a Difficulty 20 <a href="Skills.php?Name=Search">Search</a> check. Creating a larger hole suitable for firing ranged weapons through requires another <a href="Skills.php?Name=Stealth">Stealth</a> check, this one with no bonus, opposed by the <a href="Skills.php?Name=Notice">Notice</a> checks of anyone within visual range.</p>
<p><b>Stealth Outfit:</b> The traditional ninja costume, all in black, with clever hooks and pouches, and of course a mask to cover one's face. These outfits supply a +2 bonus to <a href="Skills.php?Name=Stealth">Stealth</a> checks made to hide in dark places. They also increase a ninja's <a href="PlayingPhysical.php#Carrying">carrying capacity</a>, allowing the ninja to carry a Medium load with reduced penalties. A character with <a href="Feats.php?Name=Ninja%20Weapon%20Training">Ninja Weapon Training</a> wearing a stealth outfit who is carrying a Medium load has no Max Dex and a Check Penalty of only -1. As well, they move at normal speed. A ninja wearing a Stealth outfit who is carrying a Heavy load suffers all the penalties of a normal Heavy load.</p>
<p><b>Tojime:</b> These bars and hooks come in a set, and are used to hold doors closed, for those times when a little privacy is called for, or to slow pursuit. It is a full-round action to set the tojime in place, and requires a Difficulty 12 <a href="Skills.php?Name=Disable%20Device">Disable Device</a> check. Once in place, the doorway is locked. Breaking the tojime is a Difficulty 28 Strength check, or a Difficulty 25 <a href="Skills.php?Name=Disable%20Device">Disable Device</a> check.</p>

<a name="Grenades"><h2>Grenades</h2></a>
<p>Ninjas use a variety of grenade-like weapons. Details on those weapons are provided below. Only characters with <a href="Feats.php?Name=Ninja%20Weapon%20Training">Ninja Weapon Training</a> can use grenades at all; characters without this feat are unable to throw grenades so that they go off (it's all in the wrist).</p>

<h3>Grenade Descriptions</h3>
<p><b>Smoke:</b> A smoke grenade fills the area within the listed radius with smoke of a desired colour (chosen at time of crafting the grenade), providing total <a href="CombatModifiers.php?Name=Concealment">concealment</a>. The smoke lasts for only two rounds.</p>
<p><b>Flash-Bang:</b> A flash-bang grenade gives off a bright flash and a loud bang that can render targets temporarily <a href="PlayingConditions.php?name=Blinded">blind</a> and <a href="PlayingConditions.php?name=Deafened">deaf</a> (targets save separately against each effect, Reflex Difficulty 14). Affected targets receive a Fortitude save each round against the same difficulty to recover, with a +1 bonus for each round that has passed since the grenade went off.</p>
<p><b>Poison Smoke:</b> The smoke given off by this grenade causes retching and choking in those who breath it. Anyone within the area of effect must make a Difficulty 13 Fortitude save or become <a href="PlayingConditions.php?name=Nauseated">nauseated</a>. A nauseated character can only take a single move action each round. Affected targets receive a Fortitude save each round against the same difficulty to recover, with a +1 bonus for each round that has passed since the first round the target was affected. The smoke lasts for five rounds.</p>
