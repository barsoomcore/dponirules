<h1>SAMPLE CHARACTERS: VICTORIA</h1>

<p><a href="/dponiwiki/media/files/Victoria01.pdf">Download PDF of Victoria's Character Sheet</a></p>

<img src="/dponiwiki/media/images/VictoriaThumb.png" style="float:left"><p>Victoria is a <a href="CharGenBackgrounds.php">DINO-PIRATE</a> -- in particular, she's part of the Raptor clan of DINO-PIRATES. See, the DINO-PIRATES all take their names from various dinosaurs. There's not much actual organization to these groups; not like the ninja clans, which have all their ninja rules and ninja traditions and what not. The DINO-PIRATES aren't that interested in tradition and rules anyway. So Victoria is a Raptor DINO-PIRATE, so if she meets other Raptors (possibly there's a secret handshake), she'll probably help them out if they, say, get into a fight (pirates: fighting a lot).</p>

<h2>Abilities</h2>

<p>Anyway, as a character build, Victoria is another <a href="RolesWarrior.php">Warrior</a> like <a href="CharGenChen.php">Chen</a>, but unlike that worthy fellow, Victoria is more of a swashbuckler than a tank. She's nimble, with her +4 Dexterity, and charming, with her +2 Charisma, and not all that bright, with her -1 Intelligence. We'll see why the investment in Charisma pays off for Victoria below.</p>

<p>Dexterity of course is important because it powers both her attack bonus and her Dodge, meaning she's going to connect a lot more often than she's going to get connected with. It also combines with her <a href="Feats.php?Name=Improved%20Initiative">Improved Initiative</a> feat to give her a +8 on Initiative, meaning she's almost always going to get the drop on others. She's fast, is Victoria.</p>

<p>She'll need to be, since the absence of a Toughness bonus means any blows that do connect can hurt her seriously. Victoria doesn't want to stand toe-to-toe with big bruisers and dish out -- she needs to jump and bounce around the battlefield.</p>

<h2>Skills</h2>

<p>Which her <a href="Skills.php">skills</a> will definitely help her out with. She gets <a href="Skills.php?Name=Acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> and <a href="Skills.php?Name=Bluff">Bluff</a> as bonus skills for being a Raptor DINO-PIRATE, and to that she adds another four plus her Intelligence -- which adds up to three. She takes <a href="Skills.php?Name=Diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> since it builds off her Charisma (and we want her to be very charming), <a href="Skills.php?Name=Jump">Jump</a> for obvious reasons, and <a href="Skills.php?Name=Knowledge">Knowledge (sea lore)</a> since after all, she IS a pirate (plus her low Intelligence makes her especially bad at it, and we like the idea of Victoria confidently getting her shipmates lost time and again). <a href="Skills.php?Name=Acrobatics">Acrobatics</a>, <a href="Skills.php?Name=Jump">Jump</a> and <a href="Skills.php?Name=Bluff">Bluff</a> are all great candidates for <a href="BasicsStunts.php">combat stunts</a>, and shipboard fights will probably allow a <a href="Skills.php?Name=Knowledge">Knowledge (sea lore)</a> stunt here and there, too. Despite so few skills, we're certain Victoria will get a lot of use out of them.</p>

<h2>Feats</h2>

<p>Her <a href="Feats.php">feats</a> are pretty straightforward, too. As a Raptor DINO-PIRATE she gets <a href="Feats.php?Name=Improved%20Acrobatic%20Charge">Improved Acrobatic Charge</a> and <a href="Feats.php?Name=Lucky">Lucky</a>, both of which go great with her build (high Acrobatics and Charisma), and as a Warrior she gets <a href="Feats.php?Name=Martial%20Weapon%20Training">Martial Weapon Training</a>. That leaves her with three choices -- she picks <a href="Feats.php?Name=Improved%20Initiative">Improved Initiative</a> and <a href="Feats.php?Name=Reckless%20Abandon">Reckless Abandon</a> (which allows her to add that high Charisma to her Dodge), and finally <a href="Feats.php?Name=Skill%20Focus">Skill Focus (Acrobatics)</a>, which gives her a bonus to that all-important <a href="SKills.php?Name=Acrobatics">Acrobatics</a>.</p>

<h2>Customize</h2>

<p>This sort of build is easy to tweak &mdash swap Charisma for Constitution and you have a full-on toe-to-toe combatant who can dish it out. Swap <a href="Skills.php?Name=Diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> for <a href="Skills.php?Name=Stealth">Stealth</a> and you've got a great potential for a sneak-attacking death-dealer. Chose more straightforward feats like <a href="Feats.php?Name=Attack%20Focus">Attack Focus</a> and <a href="Feats.php?Name=Tough">Tough</a> to simplify your combat options. This sort of swashbuckler is one of the most versatile and effective character builds available. Have fun!</p>

<h2>The Future</h2>

<p>Victoria's future (assuming she has one), is most likely going to stay with straight <a href="RolesWarrior.php">Warrior</a> levels. If something wacky happens there might be some <a href="RolesGeneralist.php">Generalist</a> or <a href="RolesAdept.php">Adept</a>, but with that limited Intelligence she won't get all that much use out of <a href="RolesExpert.php">Expert</a> levels. She'll probably want to take some <a href="Feats.php?Name=Attack%20Focus">Attack Focus</a>/<a href="Feats.php?Name=Attack%20Specialization">Specialization</a> feats to amp up her skill with one or the other of her weapons (and she'll probably want to get a masterwork weapon as well). <a href="Feats.php?Name=Maneuver%20Finesse">Maneuver Finesse</a> would get more use out of that Dexterity, and <a href="Feats.php?Name=Improved%20Critical">Improved Critical</a> is always a good choice for anyone with a rapier. <a href="Feats.php?Name=Move-by%20Action">Move-By Action</a> would also be handy for staying out of trouble. With lots of choices for <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Feint">feinting</a>, <a href="BasicsStunts.php">stunting</a> and generally leaping about, along with a potent combat ability, Victoria's got an exciting future ahead of her. If not a long one.</p>
