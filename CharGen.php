	<p style="font-size:70%; font-weight: bold; text-align:center">The official DPoNI character sheet!</p>
</div>
<p>You don't have to start by creating your own character: we've supplied a number of <a href="CharGenSamples.php">sample characters</a> for you to choose from if you just want to get started and not worry too much.</p>
<p>But if you DO want to create your own hero to adventure in the world of DINO-PIRATES OF NINJA ISLAND, it's not really that hard. Each step below links to a page that explains the choices you need to make. Just work your way through those and you'll have a complete character ready for adventure!</p>

<h2><a href="CharGenHistory.php">History</a></h2>
<p>Follow the steps in this section to help you come up with a background for your character. How did they get where they are and why are they hanging out with the rest of the group? Good questions to answer.</p>

<h2><a href="BasicsAbilities.php">Abilities</a></h2>
<p>You'll have to decide on the basic qualities of your character. Are they strong or fast or clever or tough as nails? In DPoNI, it's pretty easy to set that up. There are six attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma. Review <a href="BasicsAbilities.php">this section</a> and decide how you want to set those up.</p>

<h2><a href="CharGenBackgrounds.php">Backgrounds</a></h2>
<p>There are four Backgrounds for this game, each of which represents a different ancestry: Natives, Dino-Pirates, Ninjas and Imperials. Read over the options, choose one and note your choice on your character sheet.</p>

<h2><a href="Roles.php">Roles</a></h2>
<p>If you haven't already. pick one of the four roles: <a href="RolesAdept.php">Adept</a>, <a href="RolesExpert.php">Expert</a>, <a href="RolesWarrior.php">Warrior</a>, or <a href="RolesGeneralist.php">Generalist</a>. Your role will determine your <a href="BasicsCombat.php">Combat Bonus</a>, your <a href="BasicsSavingThrows.php">Saving Throws</a>, the number of <a href="Skills.php">Skills</a> you can choose, the <a href="Feats.php">Feats</a> that are available to you, and provides you with a Core Ability. Your role also determines your <a href="BasicsReputation.php">Reputation Bonus</a>. If you choose the <a href="RolesAdept.php">Adept</a> or the <a href="RolesGeneralist.php">Generalist</a> role, you will also have to choose a Key Ability that you use to control <a href="Powers.php">supernatural forces</a>.</p>

<h2><a href="BasicsCombat.php">Combat Statistics</a></h2>
<p>There's a variety of numbers used to keep track of your character's ability in combat. Don't worry too much about all of them yet, but in brief, they are:</p>

<h3><a href="Combat.php">Attack Bonus</a> and <a href="Combat.php#ManeuverBonus">Maneuver Bonus</a></h3>
<p>These numbers represent your ability to hit things.</p>

<h3><a href="Combat.php#BaseDefense">Base Defense</a>, <a href="Combat.php#Dodge">Dodge</a> and <a href="Combat.php#Parry">Parry</a></h3>
<p>On the flip side, these numbers represent your ability to NOT get hit.</p>

<h3><a href="CombatInitiative.php">Initiative Bonus</a></h3>
<p>Who goes first is determined by Initiative checks.</p>	

<h2><a href="Powers.php">Power Statistics</a></h2>
<p>If you are playing an <a href="RolesAdept.php">Adept</a> or a <a href="RolesGeneralist.php">Generalist</a>, note your Max Power Bonus and your Max Power Save Difficulty. The former is equal to your Power Rank plus your Key Ability, while the latter is equal to 9 plus half your Adept or Generalist level plus your Key Ability.</p>

<a name="Nature"><h2>Nature</h2></a>
<p>You should choose a Virtue and a Vice for your character. These will afford your character a way to regain Conviction points, so choose ones you'll have fun employing. Some samples:</p>
<p><strong>Virtues:</strong> Courageous, Free-Spirited, Bold, Generous, Gregarious, Hopeful, Daring, Thoughtful, Compassionate, Industrious, Honest, Fair, Kind, Determined</p>
<p><strong>Vices:</strong> Cowardly, Hidebound, Fearful, Miserly, Cynical, Impulsive, Selfish, Lazy, Capricious, Petty, Arrogant, Stubborm, Manipulative, Insensitive.</p>

<h2><a href="BasicsSavingThrows.php">Saving Throws</a></h2>
<p>Your Toughness save is equal to your Constitution, plus any feats you have that may apply. Your Fortitude, Reflex and Will saves are determined by your role, and apply your Constitution, Dexterity and Wisdom, respectively. There are also feats that can improve these saving throws.</p>

<h2><a href="Skills.php">Skills</a></h2>
<p>Your character starts play with a certain number of starting <a href="Skills.php">skills</a> at first level. Each starting <a href="Skills.php">skill</a> begins with four ranks. The exact number of starting <a href="Skills.php">skills</a> you can choose will depend on your <a href="CharGenBackgrounds.php">Background</a>, your <a href="Roles.php">Role</a> and your Intelligence. You may have already chosen some as you went through the above process, but review your choices and make sure they follow the rules AND reflect your character concept. If you still have a few slots free, go through the lists and select <a href="Skills.php">skills</a> to round out your choices.</p>

<h2><a href="Feats.php">Feats</a> and <a href="Powers.php">Powers</a></h2>
<p>As with <a href="Skills.php">skills</a>, the number of <a href="Feats.php">feats</a> and <a href="Powers.php">powers</a> you can choose will depend on your Background and your Role. You may have already chosen some as you went through the above process, but review your choices and make sure they follow the rules AND reflect your character concept. If you still have a few slots free, go through the lists and select <a href="Feats.php">feats</a> or <a href="Powers.php">powers</a> to round out your choices. Remember that only <a href="RolesAdept.php">Adepts</a> or <a href="RolesGeneralist.php">Generalists</a> can choose <a href="Powers.php">powers</a> in place of <a href="Feats.php">feats</a>.</p>

<h2>Core Ability</h2>
<p>Note your Role's Core Ability on your character sheet.</p>

<h2><a href="BasicsConviction.php">Conviction Points</a></h2>
<p>First-level characters start play with three <a href="BasicsConviction.php">Conviction</a> points. Mark these on your character sheet, but remember you'll be using and adding <a href="BasicsConviction.php">Conviction</a> points all the time.</p>

<h2><a href="BasicsReputation.php">Reputation</a></h2>
<p>A character's <a href="BasicsReputation.php">Reputation</a> modifier determines how well-known they are. As characters rise in level, their fame (or infamy) increase as well. Sometimes, being recognized can be a big advantage. Other times, not so much.</p>
