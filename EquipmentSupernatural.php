<h1>SUPERNATURAL ITEMS</h1>

<p>Many and varied are the marvels of the world of the DINO-PIRATES. The ordinary folks and beasts and creations found within the maze of islands are fantastic enough, but even more so are the items found imbued with supernatural power.</p>

<p>Spirit fetishes, stern totems, empowered gems and walking swords, potions, charms and the dark holy items of legendary worship are seen, stolen and occasionally made use of throughout the kingdoms and ports of these jungle-strewn islands.</p>

<h2>Single-Use Items</h2>

<p>A single-use supernatural item is simply the effect of a supernatural power stored in a receptacle to be released later when the item is activated. The power check is made, the save Difficulty is set, and the specific effect of the (if the power has more than one potential effect) is chosen at the time of the item's creation.</p>

<p>To create a single-use supernatural item, a character must have the <a href="Feats.php?Name=Imbue%20Item">Imbue Item</a> feat and the appropriate supernatural power. First, the proper components must be purchased. The components to make a single-use item have a purchase Difficulty of 6 + 1 per 5 ranks of power check bonus that the adept wishes to imbue. Next, a Difficulty 15 <a href="Skills.php?Name=Craft">Craft</a> check of the appropriate type is necessary to create the item. For example, potions require a <a href="Skills.php?Name=Craft">Craft (alchemy)</a> check and scrolls or written charms require a <a href="Skills.php?Name=Craft">Craft (calligraphy)</a> check. The enchanting of the item must take place between scenes, or requires a full scene itself. Finally the character must make a <a href="Skills.php?Name=Knowledge">Knowledge (supernatural)</a> check (Difficulty 15) and spend a Conviction point to seal the effect into the item until it is released. The character may choose to take 10 on the <a href="Skills.php?Name=Craft">Craft</a>, <a href="Skills.php?Name=Knowledge">Knowledge (supernatural)</a> and power checks. If any of these checks fail, the process must begin anew.</p>

<h3>Ammunition</h3>
<p>When crafting supernatural ammunition it is possible to enchant multiple items at once. Up to 20 arrows or 10 bullets may be imbued with power as though a single item. The effect imbued into these items is released when the ammunition is fired.</p>

<h3>Charms</h3>
<p>Charms are small ornate objects that hold the effects of a power until the bearer activates the charm. The craft skill used to create them varies with the materials that the charm is made of. Activating a charm requires either a standard of a move action.</p>

<h3>Oils</h3>
<p>Oils are alchemical concoctions that can be poured over a weapon to temporarily imbue it with supernatural power. Oils are created with the <a href="Skills.php?Name=Craft">Craft (alchemy)</a> skill and require either a standard of a move action to apply them to a weapon, at which point their supernatural effects are activated.</p>

<h3>Potions &amp; Elixirs</h3>
<p>Potions and elixirs are ingestible supernatural liquids brewed with the <a href="Skills.php?Name=Craft">Craft (alchemy)</a> skill. These liquids must be ingested in order for their imbued supernatural power to take effect.</p>

<h3>Scrolls</h3>
<p>Scrolls are supernatural powers inscribed on paper or parchment with the <a href="Skills.php?Name=Craft">Craft (calligraphy)</a> skill. A scroll can have one of several modes of activation, chosen when it is created: attachment, reading, or burning.</p>

<p>Scrolls activated by attachment must be pinned to the person or object that they are to affect in order to activate their supernatural contents. This action may require an attack roll if the target is unwilling, but it can be performed by anyone. Once the effects of the power are expended, the scroll disintegrates.</p>

<p>Scrolls activated by reading can be read by anyone making a Difficulty 20 <a href="Skills.php?Name=Knowledge">Knowledge (supernatural)</a> check. This requires a standard action. Some such scrolls may have multiple supernatural powers inscribed onto them, though each one must be imbued separately as if it were on a separate scroll. As each powers individually read and activated, the supernatural writing fades from the page. Once all powers on such a scroll are read and expended, the scroll disintegrates.</p>

<p>Scrolls activated by burning simply require that the scroll be touched to or cast into an open flaame in order to release their magic. This requires a standard action and can be performed by anyone.</p>

<h2>Multi-Use Items</h2>
<p>Multi-use supernatural items are imbued with a single supernatural power (and feats that modify that power). They are limited to a certain number of uses or "charges" of the effect. The item's wielder may use a standard action to activate one of the item's charges and gain the benefits of the imbued power as though they had just made a power check equal to their level + 10. The save Difficult for the powers of a multi-use item is equal to 10 + 1/2 the wielder's level (adepts may add their key ability). Once all the charges are expended, the item loses its supernatural qualities.</p>

<p>The creator must have the <a href="Feats.php?Name=Imbue%20Item">Imbue Item</a> feat and the appropriate power. The process requires first a masterwork item of the type being enchanted. The construction of these items must be done between scenes, or else takes an entire scene, and the creator automatically takes a carry-over condition of <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Winded">Winded</a> for the next scene. At the end of the process, the creator makes a power check with the imbued power (Difficulty 15 + 1 per charge to be imbued). Any fatigue save the power may require also has its Difficulty increased by +1 per charge to be imbued. The creator must then spend a number of Conviction points equal to 1 + the number of feats to be imbued. The <a href="Skills.php?Name=Knowledge">Knowledge (supernatural)</a> check required to seal the enchantment has a Difficulty of 10 + 1 per feat the item is imbued with. If any of these checks fail, the process must begin over again.</p>

<h2>Permanent Items</h2>
<p>Anyone wielding a permanent supernatural item gains the benefits of the feats and powers with which the item is imbued. When someone without power ranks accesses a power through a supernatural item, the do not risk fatigue or make a power check. Instead they gain benefits from the power as though their power check had been equal to their level + 5. This means that certain effects of any given power may not be accessible to lower level characters using the item. Characters with power ranks may choose to use a supernatural power in the item normally, just as though they were using one of their own supernatural powers. The wielder of a supernatural item may spend a Conviction point to gain a +3 bonus to their power check as though they were using the <a href="Feats.php?Name=Empower">Empower</a> feat. The save Difficulty for any powers within a permanent supernatural item is 10 + 1/2 the wielder's level (adepts may add their key ability).</p>

<p>Creating a permanent supernatural item is an expensives and difficult process and requires the creator to have the <a href="Feats.php?Name=Imbue%20Item">Imbue Item</a> feat and the appropriate power(s). Creation of these items first requires a masterwork item specially created to serve as the receptacle for the imbued powers. Other special components may be required that can only be acquired with some difficulty (and heroics).</p>

<p>The enchanting process must happen between scenes, or else takes up a full scene, and the creator automatically takes a carry-over condition of <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Fatigued">Fatigued</a> for the next scene. The creator must succeed on a Difficulty 25 check with each power to be permanently imbued into the item. If the item being imbued is a weapon, <a href="Powers.php?Name=Supernatural%20Weapon">Supernatural Weapon</a> must be on of the powers fiven to it. Finally, the creator must spend a number of Conviction points equal to the number of powers and featurs imbued and succeed on a <a href="Skills.php?Name=Knowledge">Knowledge (supernatural)</a> check (Difficulty 20 + 2 per imbued power and +1 per imbued feat). If any of these checks fail, the process must begin again.</p>
