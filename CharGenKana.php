<h1>SAMPLE CHARACTERS: KANA</h1>

<p><a href="/dponiwiki/media/files/Kana01.pdf">Download PDF of Kana's Character Sheet</a></p>

<img src="/dponiwiki/media/images/KanaThumb.png" style="float:left"><p>Kana is an <a href="RolesAdept.php">adept</a>, with her focus on managing animals, in particular the big showcase animals of DINO-PIRATES OF NINJA ISLAND, the dinosaurs. While she can work effectively with any sorts of animals, she's taken a couple of feats to zero in on the big beasts. The concept is a young woman from the jungle with the uncanny ability to befriend and command dangerous beasts. She's got serious presence and is hard to flummox.</p>

<p>Let's review how she's put together. Ahem.</p>

<p>To start with, she's a <a href="CharGenBackgrounds">Native</a>. That gives her the bonus skills of <a href="Skills.php?Name=Notice">Notice</a> and <a href="Skills.php?Name=Survival">Survival</a>, which will play nice with the Wisdom we want to give her, and for bonus feats she gets Exotic Weapon Training and Trailblazer.</p>

<h2>Abilities</h2>

<p>When choosing her attributes, we're going to give her a big honking +4 on Charisma, and +1 on Wisdom and a +1 on Constitution. She's unlikely to get into much combat but the Constitution gives her a bit of survivability, and the Wisdom will help out with <a href="Skills.php?Name=Notice">Notice</a> and <a href="Skills.php?Name=Survival">Survival</a>, her bonus skills (and skills that play well into her concept). Since we see her as someone who can get to the truth easily, we're going to give her <a href="Skills.php?Name=Sense%20Motive">Sense Motive</a> as well, so the Wisdom plays well. </p>

<p>Combat-wise she's not very effective, with no bonuses whatsoever at first level. Anyone who takes a swing at her has a pretty good chance of connecting, so she's going to want to stay out of combat as much as possible.</p>

<h2>Skills</h2>

<p>Her skills play off her feat of Animal Empathy -- that feat lets her use <a href="Skills.php?Name=Handle%20Animal">Handle Animal</a> as <a href="Skills.php?Name=Diplomacy">Diplomacy</a>, AND lets her use <a href="Skills.php?Name=Bluff">Bluff</a> and <a href="Skills.php?Name=Gather%20Information">Gather Information</a> with animals. So obviously she takes those three, and as mentioned above she's also going to take <a href="Skills.php?Name=Sense%20Motive">Sense Motive</a> to get more use out of that Wisdom point.</p>

<p>She's going to be reasonably effective with that Animal Empathy; her +8 on <a href="Skills.php?Name=Handle%20Animal">Handle Animal</a> means she'll almost always be able to, for example, convince a deinonychus to do what she wants (4th level animal, +1 Wisdom = Difficulty 15). A T-Rex is going to be tougher -- 18th level and +2 Wisdom makes for a Difficulty of 30. Might want to wait on walking into a T-Rex nest for a few levels, there, Kana.</p>

<h2>Powers</h2>

<p>Of course, if her skills fail her, she's got her supernatural powers. With the philosophy of <a href="PowersPhilosophies.php">Shamanism</a> she gets a bonus rank on both <a href="Powers.php?Name=Beast%20Link">Beast Link</a> and <a href="Powers.php?Name=Dominate">Dominate</a>, and a T-Rex only gets a +8 Will save, so with a Power save Difficulty of 17, that's not looking quite so crazy. Because she doesn't have <a href="Powers.php?Name=Mind%20Link">Mind Link</a>, only <a href="Powers.php?Name=Beast%20Link">Beast Link</a>, her <a href="Powers.php?Name=Dominate">Dominate</a> power can only be used against animals, which is exactly what we want. That Wisdom comes in handy here again, helping Kana with those pesky Resilience checks.</p>

<h2>Feats</h2>

<p>Her feat choices are pretty obvious: Shamanism requires a <a href="Feats.php?Name=Power%20Focus">Power Focus</a> choice -- the rules say it has to be a natural location, but the relatively narrow choice of "Dinos" is a reasonable substitute here (she'll take a penalty on Resilience saves whenever she's not using her powers against dinosaurs). We can imagine Kana comes from a nation that worships dinosaur spirits, perhaps, and elaborate totem poles with snarling raptors and triceratops heads rising up in front of the tribal houses. Since she gets <a href="Feats.php?Name=Exotic%20Weapon%20Training">Exotic Weapon Training</a> for free, we choose "chakram", since it can end up being pretty effective as a ranged weapon.</p>

<h2>Customizing</h2>

<p>You could easily recast Kana as a more traditional supporting character, by giving her the <a href="Powers.php?Name=Cure">Cure</a> and <a href="Powers.php?Name=Ward">Ward</a> powers. Doing so, you'd want to change her <a href="Feats.php?Name=Power%20Focus">Power Focus</a> and perhaps select "Jungle" as a preferred location. A character focused on powers like <a href="Powers.php?Name=Object%20Reading">Object Reading</a> and <a href="Powers.php?Name=Visions">Visions</a> would also be interesting.</p>

<h2>The Future</h2>

<p>It's possible Kana will take the <a href="Feats.php?Name=Chakram%20Tricks">Chakram Tricks</a> feat down the road and turn into a Xena-esque figure, commanding dinosaurs and sending out whirling, ricocheting disks of death in all directions.</p>

<p>Or perhaps not. Depending on how the campaign goes, Kana might remain a straight-up <a href="RolesAdept.php">Adept</a>, building her array of powers, or she might take a few levels in either <a href="RolesExpert.php">Expert</a> or <a href="RolesGeneralist.php">Generalist</a>, expanding her skill and feat selection. If the chakram works out, a <a href="Feats.php?Name=Sneak%20Attack">Sneak Attack</a> or some such feat might be appropriate. She could also work on getting more out of her "face" skills, using feats like <a href="Feats.php?Name=Fascinate">Fascinate</a> or <a href="Feats.php?Name=Suggestion">Suggestion</a> against dinosaurs. That sounds like fun. But of course the <a href="RolesAdept.php">Adept</a> list includes <a href="Feats.php?Name=Familiar">Familiar</a>, and it seems very in character for Kana to end up with a faithful tiny dino companion.</p>
