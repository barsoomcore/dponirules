<h1>SAMPLE CHARACTERS: CHEN</h1>

<p><a href="/dponiwiki/media/files/Chen01.pdf">Download PDF of Chen's Character Sheet</a></p>

<img src="/dponiwiki/media/images/ChenThumb.png" style="float:left"><p>Meet stalwart Chen, former Imperial Marine gone pirate. Chen came to the islands as part of a punitive fleet expedition, but when he saw how the Empire oppressed the courageous islanders, his heart was forever turned against the vast nation that had spawned him. Now he saves his special hatred for the agents of the Empire that always seek to overrun the free islands.</p>

<h2>Abilities</h2>

<p>Chen is a very basic sort of character, what passes for a front-line tank in DPoNI. His Dexterity is pretty high &mdash; in DPoNI Dexterity determines your attack bonus, so it's critical for front-line fighters. His Strength is higher, which gives him a brutal damage bonus (+6 for the battleaxe), meaning he'll very likely seriously injure his foes anytime he connects. The one point of Constitution is a little low for a tank, so Chen wears leather armour to help protect himself. But Chen has popped one point into Charisma, even dropping his Wisdom to do so. We'll look at the reasoning here below.</p>

<h2>Skills</h2>

<p>Chen's <a href="Skills.php">skill list</a> is never going to be very broad. He opted for most of the fundamental Strength/Dexterity skills like <a href="Skills.php?Name=Climb">Climb</a>, <a href="Skills.php?Name=Jump">Jump</a>, <a href="Skills.php?Name=Stealth">Stealth</a> and <a href="Skills.php?Name=Swim">Swim</a>. Missing is <a href="Skills.php?Name=Acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> -- this is mostly just a concept thing. Chen as an Imperial Marine just isn't the sort of nimble swashbuckler that a character like <a href="CharGenVictoria.php">Victoria</a> needs to be. But he does get <a href="Skills.php?Name=Concentration">Concentration</a> and <a href="Skills.php?Name=Intimidate">Intimidate</a> for free as an Imperial. <a href="Skills.php?Name=Concentration">Concentration</a>, with his low Wisdom, is a bit of write-off (and not so useful for a fighter), but <a href="Skills.php?Name=Intimidate">Intimidate</a> is a great choice, and here's where Chen's point of Charisma helps out. A +5 on <a href="Skills.php?Name=Intimidate">Intimidate</a> means Chen can readily use this skill in combat, either using the <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Feint">feint action</a> to startle his opponents with his menacing manner, or by using the provoke feature in Intimidate to protect his less combat-proof friends.</p>

<h2>Feats</h2>

<p>His feat selection is likewise unsurprising. Picking up <a href="Feats.php?Name=Armor%20Training">Armor Training</a> basically means getting a free Toughness bonus, and perhaps if he gets some <a href="EquipmentWealth.php">wealth</a> down the line he can get more effective armor than he currently has. It's a tradeoff though, with his physical skills since the Armor Check Penalty in DPoNI is so much more crippling -- and that effects not only the use of the skills but the ability to <a href="BasicsStunts.php">Stunt</a> off them. He'd have a +2 Stunt Bonus from <a href="Skills.php?Name=Climb">Climb</a>, <a href="Skills.php?Name=Jump">Jump</a> and <a href="Skills.php?Name=Stealth">Stealth</a> without the armor, so that Toughness bonus comes at a cost. Which ends up making the focus on <a href="Skills.php?Name=Intimidate">Intimidate</a> even more important.</p>

<h2>Customizing</h2>

<p>Chen spent a lot acquiring the <a href="EquipmentArmor.php">armor</a>, the <a href="EquipmentWeapons.php?Name=Battleaxe">battleaxe</a> and the <a href="EquipmentWeapons.php?Name=Bow%2C+long">bow</a> -- his <a href="EquipmentWealth.php">Wealth bonus</a> is a measly +2 after all those purchases, so it might be prudent to lose the bow, or even the armor. Of course it's always possible to put that Charisma point into Constitution instead, but Chen's options get a lot more limited at that point. Another easy swap is Strength and Dexterity -- although if you bump up his Dexterity, you might want to review the skill list to take advantage of that increase.</p>

<p>This basic model could be adapted for a world-weary swordsman (<a href="Feats.php?Name=Attack%20Focus">Attack Focus (sword)</a>) or a barroom brawler (<a href="Feats.php?Name=Improved%20Strike">Improved Strike</a>), or even a character specializing in an exotic weapon like the <a href="EquipmentWeapons.php?Name=Raptor%20Claws">raptor claws</a>.</p>

<h2>The Future</h2>

<p>Down the line Chen would want to look at putting some more focus into that battleaxe -- <a href="Feats.php?Name=Attack%20Specialization">Attack Specialization</a> to increase the damage, <a href="Feats.php?Name=Intimidating%20Prowess">Intimidating Prowess</a> would get him more use out of the <a href="Skills.php?Name=Intimidate">Intimidate</a> skill, and <a href="Feats.php?Name=Parry%20Focus">Parry Focus</a> would build on his already-formidable Parry. <a href="Feats.php?Name=Cleave">Cleave</a> is another good bet, and he'll want to take a <a href="Feats.php?Name=Tough">Tough</a> feat every few levels as the opponents get nastier. He'll continue to max out <a href="Skills.php?Name=Intimidate">Intimidate</a>, and then depending on the turn the campaign takes keep putting skill ranks into <a href="Skills.php?Name=Climb">Climb</a>, <a href="Skills.php?Name=Jump">Jump</a> or <a href="Skills.php?Name=Stealth">Stealth</a> (or <a href="Skills.php?Name=Swim">Swim</a> if that seems appropriate).</p>
