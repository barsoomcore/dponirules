Different ancestral guardians appear differently, but they are all set with numerous precious-looking stones. They do not obey commands but instead act of their own accord to defend the community whose souls they bear.|<b>Heavy Step:</b> Ancestral guardians only move three times their speed when they run.</p><p><b>Soul Pool:</b> An ancestral guardian relies on the crystallized essences of the dead for its power. Each soul contributes points to a soul pool that the ancestral guardian can draw upon in order to use some of its special abilities. An encountered ancestral guardian will have a number of souls in its possession equal to one or two times its level. The maximum number of souls an ancestral guardian may posses is four times its level. Using points from the pool does not destroy the souls, but it exhausts their energy for a time. Points used return at a rate of one point per day.</p><p><b>Soul Driven:</b> An ancestral guardian's soul pool fuels not only its special abilities, but also its ability to animate itself. Should an ancestral guardian deplete its soul pool entirely, it weakens itself to a point that it can do nothing more than take a single <a href="CombatActions.php?Time=Move">move action</a> each round. This state persists until the ancestral guardian has recovered at least one point to its soul pool.</p><p><b>Gather Soul:</b> Any member of the ancestral guardian's protected community reduced to <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Dying">dying</a> within 60 feet of the ancestral guardian has its soul drawn into the guardian's soul pool. Each soul adds a number of points to the ancestral guardian's soul pool equal to the dying character's level. If these points exceed the ancestral guardian's maximum, the soul cannot be drawn into the pool.</p><p><b>Retaliatory Strike:</b> An ancestral guardian gets a +2 bonus on attack rolls against any creature that struck them in the previous round. Even an ancestral guardian that has expended its entire soul pool may make an attack against a creature that struck it last round.</p><p><b>Special Powers:</b> In addition to the abilities described above, ancestral guardians will have one or more of the following special abilities:</p><p><i>Guard:</i> As a reaction, an ancestral guardian can choose to absorb any damage dealt to an adjacent creature or object from its community. Guardians cannot block any damage that is not opposed by a Toughness save. By expending 1 point from its soul pool, the ancestral guardian takes half the damage dealt to the creature or object it is guarding, and the creature or object takes half as well. If the ancestral guardian expends 2 points from its soul pool, it takes the full damage and the guarded creature or object takes none.</p><p><i>Improved Retaliatory Strike:</i> An ancestral spirit can expend a point from its soul pool to gain an additional +2 bonus to its retaliatory strike attack, and to gain a +1 bonus on damage dealt by that attack.</p><p><i>Ancestral Wrath:</i> Some ancestral guardians may use supernatural <a href="Powers.php">powers</a>. They use these powers with power ranks equal to their level.

A mature plant consists of a main vine, about 20 feet long. Smaller vines up to 5 feet long branch off from the main vine about every 6 inches. These small vines bear clusters of leaves, and in late summer they produce bunches of small fruits that resemble wild grapes. The fruit is tough and has a hearty but bitter flavour. Assassin vine berries make a heady wine. An assassin vine can move about, albeit very slowly, but usually stays put unless it needs to seek prey in a new vicinity.</p><p>A subterranean version of the assassin vine grows near hot springs, volcanic vents and other sources of thermal energy. These plants have thin, wiry stems and gray leaves shot through with silver, brown and white veins so that they resemble mineral deposits. An assassin vine growing underground usually generates enough offal to support a thriving colony of mushrooms and other fungi, which spring up around the plant and help conceal it.</p><p>An assassin vine uses simple tactics: It lies still until prey comes within reach, and then attacks.

The afflicted individual experiences vivid nightmares of starvation and cannibalism. The victim can resist the effects of this dream with a Difficulty 24 Will save. Failure indicates the victim takes a level of fatigue as they sleep, but can't quite remember the nature of their dreams. After failing two of these saves against the same cannibal spirit, the victim contracts <em>Cannibal Fever</em> (see below).

Sometimes those who practice cannibalism of their own accord also develop these symptoms.</p><p>Cannibal Fever acts as a <a href="CreaturesTraits.php?Name=Disease">disease</a>. It has an incubation period of 1 day, and inflicts a point of Wisdom damage each day the victim fails a Difficulty 22 Will save.

Cannibal Fever cannot reduce a victim's Wisdom to lower than -5, but once this point is reached, the victim seeks out other humans to kill and consume.</p><p>Once a victim actually commits an act of cannibalism, a cannibal spirit takes over the victim's body, and screaming, the victim is drawn up into the air, to be transformed into a new spirit of cannibalism.|
