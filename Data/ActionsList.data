Name|Time|Type|Description|
Aid|Standard|Basic|If you are in position to attack an opponent, you can attempt to aid a friend engaged in melee with that opponent as a standard action. Make an attack roll against a Difficulty of 10. If you succeed, you don't actually damage the opponent &mdash; but your friend gains either a +2 bonus on an <a href="Combat.php#AttackBonus">attack roll</a> (or <a href="Combat.php#ManeuverBonus">maneuver roll</a>) against that opponent or a +2 bonus to <a href="Combat.php#BaseDefense">Defense</a> against that opponent (your choice) on the friend's next turn. Multiple aid bonuses stack.|
Aim|Full|Basic|By taking a full action to aim and line up an attack, you get a bonus to hit when you make the attack. If you're making a melee or unarmed attack, or a ranged attack at melee range, you get a +5 bonus on your attack roll. If you're making a ranged attack from a greater distance, you get a +2 bonus on your <a href="Combat.php#AttackBonus">attack roll</a>. If you aim to hit an immobile object, you hit automatically with a melee attack and get a +4 bonus on a ranged attack.</p><p>However, while aiming you cannot use your <a href="Combat.php#Dodge">Dodge</a> or <a href="Combat.php#Parry">Parry</a>, and if you are struck or distracted in any way before your attack, you have to make a <a href="Skills.php?Name=Concentration">Concentration</a> check to maintain your aim. This tends to make aiming melee attacks &mdash; or ranged attacks while adjacent to an enemy &mdash; extremely unwise.</p><p>Once you aim, your next action must be to make the attack. Taking another <a href="CombatActions.php?Time=Standard">standard</a> or <a href="CombatActions.php?Time=Move">move action</a> spoils your aim and you lose the aiming bonus.|
Attack|Standard|Basic|With a standard action, you can make an attack against any opponent within the attack's range. This is the basic use of your <a href="Combat.php#AttackBonus">attack bonus</a>.</p><h5>Shooting or Throwing into Melee</h5><p>If you make a ranged attack against an opponent engaged in melee with an ally, you take a -4 penalty on your <a href="Combat.php#AttackBonus">attack roll</a> because you have to aim carefully to avoid hitting your ally. Two characters are engaged in melee if they are opponents and adjacent to one another. (An <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Unconscious">unconscious</a> or otherwise immobilized character is not considered engaged unless he or she is actually being attacked.)</p><p>If you have the <a href="Feats.php?Name=Precise%20Shot">Precise Shot</a> feat, you ignore the penalty for shooting or throwing into melee.|
Begin/Complete Full Action|Standard|Basic|This action lets you start a <a href="CombatActions.php?Time=Full">full action</a> at the end of your turn, or complete a <a href="CombatActions.php?Time=Full">full action</a> by using a <a href="CombatActions.php?Time=Standard">standard action</a> at the beginning of your turn the round after starting the action.</p><p>If you start a <a href="CombatActions.php?Time=Full">full action</a> at the end of your turn, the next action you take must be to complete it.|
Bull Rush|Standard|Maneuver|You can make a bull rush as a standard action or as part of a <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Charge">charge</a>. A bull rush attempts to push an opponent straight back without doing any harm.</p><p>Make a <a href="Combat.php#ManeuverBonus">combat maneuver check</a>. If your manuever is successful, your target is pushed back 5 feet. For every 5 by which your combat maneuver result exceeds the Difficulty you can push the target back an additional 5 feet. You can move with the target if you wish but you must have the available movement to do so. If your attempt fails, your movement ends in front of the target.|
Charge|Full|Basic|Charging allows you to move more than your speed and attack as a full action. You must move at least 10 feet and may move up to twice your speed. You must stop as soon as you are within striking range of your target (you can't run past the target and attack from another direction).</p><p>During the surprise round, you can use the charge action, but you are only allowed to move up to your speed (instead of up to twice your speed). This is also true in other cases where you are limited to a single standard or move action per round.</p><p>After moving, you may make a single melee attack. You get a +2 bonus on the <a href="Combat.php#AttackBonus">attack roll</a> and also take a -2 penalty to your <a href="Combat.php#BaseDefense">Defense</a> for 1 round (until the beginning of your action the following round).</p><p>With a succesful Difficulty 15 <a href="Skills.php?Name=Acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> check, any character can take a charge action that involves changes of direction or nimble movement, or even incorporating a <a href="Skills.php?Name=Jump">Jump</a> check. If a character wishes to jump as part of their charge, they first make the <a href="Skills.php?Name=Acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> check, to determine if they can perform the charge, then they make a <a href="Skills.php?Name=Jump">Jump</a> check to determine if they can jump the distance required. If the <a href="Skills.php?Name=Acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> check is failed, they can still move and still attempt the <a href="Skills.php?Name=Jump">Jump</a>, but their movement is not considered a charge.|
Combined Attack|Standard|Basic|Multiple attackers can attempt to combine their attacks to overwhelm an opponent's defenses. The attackers must all delay to the same point in the <a href="CombatInitiative.php">initiative</a> order (that of the slowest character). Each attacker makes a normal <a href="Combat.php#AttackBonus">attack roll</a> against the target. Take the largest <a href="Combat.php#Damage">damage bonus</a> of the attacks that hit, and for each other attack within 5 points of that attack's bonus that hits, add +2.</p><p>Although a combined attack is similar to <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Aid">aiding</a> someone, it is not the same, and bonuses applying to <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Aid">aid</a> do not apply to combined attacks.|
Command|Move|Basic|Issuing a command to a minion or a character under the effects of a power like <a href="Powers.php?Name=Dominate">Dominate</a> requires a move action. If you want to issue different commands to different groups of minions, each one requires a move action (so you can issue two commands per round as a full action).|
Concentrate|Standard|Basic|Concentrating to maintain a particular effect, or focusing intently on a task, counts as a standard action, meaning you cannot attack while concentrating, although you can still take move actions and free actions. If anything happens that may disrupt your concentration, you have to make a <a href="Skills.php?Name=Concentration">Concentration</a> check to maintain it.|
Delay|Free|Basic|By choosing to delay, you act at a later point in the <a href="CombatInitiative.php">initiative</a> order than your rolled initiative. When you delay, you voluntarily reduce your initiative for the rest of the combat. When your new, lower initiative count comes up later in the same round, you can act normally. You can specify this new initiative total or just wait until some time later in the round and act then, fixing your new initiative at that point.</p><p>Delaying is useful if you need to see what your friends or enemies are going to do before deciding what to do yourself. The price you pay is lost initiative. You never get back the time you spent waiting to see what was going to happen.</p><h5>Delaying Limits</h5><p>The lowest you can voluntarily lower your initiative is -10 minus your initiative bonus. When the initiative count reaches that point, you must act or forfeit any action for the round. For instance, a character with an initiative bonus of 3 could wait until the initiative count reached 0, then wait for it to reach -10, but would have to act on -13 or forfeit any action for the round. This is primarily an issue when multiple characters delay.</p><h5>Multiple Characters Delaying</h5><p>If multiple characters are delaying, the one with the highest initiative bonus (or higher Dexterity, in case of a tie) has the advantage. If two or more delaying characters want to act on the same initiative count, the one with the highest bonus goes first. If two or more delaying characters are trying to go after each other, the one with the highest initiative bonus gets to go last.|
Disarm|Standard|Maneuver|You can attempt to disarm your opponent as a standard action. You may use either your <a href="Combat.php#ManeuverBonus">maneuver bonus</a> or your <a href="Combat.php#AttackBonus">attack bonus</a> with the weapon you are using to make a disarm attempt, against your opponent's Combat Maneuver Difficulty. If you are unarmed (possessing the <a href="Feats.php?Name=Improved%20Strike">Improved Strike</a> feat counts as armed), you take a -4 penalty on your disarm attempt. Using a ranged attack to attempt a disarm likewise imposes a -4 penalty on the roll.</p><p>If your attempt is successful, your target drops one item it is carrying of your choice. If your result exceeds the Difficulty of the target by 10 or more, the target drops the items it is carrying in both hands (maximum two items if the target has more than two hands). If your result fails by 10 or more, you drop the weapon that you were using to attempt the disarm. If you successfully disarm your opponent without using a weapon, you may automatically pick up the item dropped.|
Drop an Item|Free|Basic|Dropping a held item is a free action, although dropping or throwing an item with the intention of accurately hitting something is a standard action.|
Drop Prone|Free|Basic|Dropping to a prone position is a free action, although getting up requires a move action unless you are trained in <a href="Skills.php?Name=Acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> and make a successful check to Instant Up.|
Feint|Standard|Basic|You can exploit your skills to take your opponent at unawares in combat. To succeed, make a skill check as a standard action in melee. Your foe opposes your result with a base attack check; alternatively, if your skill would normally be opposed by another skill or saving throw, they may roll that instead. If you win the opposed roll, you may choose one of two effects:</p><ol><li><b><a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Flat-Footed">Flat-Footed</a>:</b> Your foe cannot use their <a href="Combat.php#Dodge">Dodge</a> or <a href="Combat.php#Parry">Parry</a> against the next attack that targets them (provided it is made before the end of your next turn).</li><li><b><a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Shaken">Shaken</a>:</b> Your foe suffers a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, checks and saving throws (except Toughness) for one round.</li></ol><p>At a minimum, you can attempt this action with the <a href="Skills.php?Name=Acrobatics">Acrobatics</a>, <a href="Skills.php?Name=Jump">Jump</a>, <a href="Skills.php?Name=Intimidate">Intimidate</a>, <a href="Skills.php?Name=Bluff">Bluff</a>, <a href="Skills.php?Name=Perform">Perform</a> (dance), <a href="Skills.php?Name=Ride">Ride</a> and <a href="Skills.php?Name=Sleight%20of%20Hand">Sleight of Hand</a> skills. You can also use this with any other skill you have, provided you can come up with a suitably plausible description of its use, and the skill would normally take a standard action to complete. What counts as plausible is left to the Narrator's discretion.|
Grapple|Standard|Maneuver|As a standard action, you can attempt to grapple a foe, hindering their combat options. Attempting to grapple a foe without two free hands imposes a -4 penalty on the roll.</p><p>Make a <a href="Combat.php#ManeuverBonus">combat maneuver check</a>. If successful, you have grappled your opponent, and both you and your opponent gain the <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Grappled">grappled</a> condition. You must continue to make a check, as a standard action, each round to maintain the hold. If your target does not break the grapple, you get a +5 circumstance bonus on grapple checks made against the same target next round.</p><p>Once you are successfully grappling an opponent, a successful check allows you to continue grappling the foe, and also allows you to perform one of the following actions.</p><ul><li><b>Move:</b> You can move both you and your target up to half your speed. At the end of your movement, you can place your target anywhere beside you.</li><li><b>Damage:</b> You can inflict damage to your target equal to your unarmed damage. This damage can be either lethal or nonlethal.</li><li><b>Pin:</b> You can give your opponent the <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Pinned">pinned</a> condition. Despite pinning your opponent, you still only have the <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Grappled">grappled</a> condition.</li><li><b>Throw:</b> You can pick up and throw your opponent like an inanimate object. The throw occurs as a move action as part of the grapple (making grabbing, grappling and throwing an opponent a full-round action). The distance you can throw an opponent is based on weight like any other object, and a throw automatically ends the grapple.</li></ul><p>If you are grappled, you can attempt to break the grapple as a standard action by making a combat maneuver roll or <a href="Skills.php?Name=Escape%20Artist">Escape Artist</a> check (Difficulty 15 + opponent's <a href="Combat.php#ManeuverBonus">maneuver bonus</a>). If you succeed, you break the grapple and can act normally.</p><p>If you have your target <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Pinned">pinned</a> or otherwise restrained, or <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Unconscious">unconscious</a>, you can use rope to tie them up. This works like a pin effect, using your CMB + 5 to determine the Difficulty to escape the bonds. The ropes do not need to make a check every round to maintain the pin. If you are grappling the target, you can attempt to tie them up in ropes, but doing so requires a combat maneuver check at a -10 penalty.|
Manipulate an Object|Move|Basic|In most cases, moving or manipulating an object is a move action. This includes drawing or holstering a weapon, retrieving or putting away a stored object, picking up an object, moving a heavy object, and opening a door.|
Mental Grapple|Standard|Basic|Characters with the <a href="Powers.php?Name=Mind%20Link">Mind Link</a> or <a href="Powers.php?Beast%20Link">Beast Link</a> powers can grapple an opponent mentally rather than physically, a struggle of mind against mind. Mental grappling uses the same system as <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Grapple">physical grappling</a>, with the following differences:</p><ul><li>A mental grapple requires a successful use of <a href="Powers.php?Name=Mind%20Link">Mind Link</a> or <a href="Beast%20Link">Beast Link</a> to establish mental contact. Mental grapples do not require physical contact, but do require a standard action each round, as usual. If the attacker stops maintaining the power at any time, the mental grapple ends.</li><li>Mental grapple checks are d20 + the character's Will save or the character's <a href="Powers.php?Name=Mind%20Link">Mind Link</a>, <a href="Beast%20Link">Beast Link</a> or <a href="Powers.php?Name=Psychic%20Shield">Psychic Shield</a> bonus (whichever is greater). Strength modifiers do not apply.</li><li>You cannot move or throw an opponent using a mental grapple, only damage or pin.</li><li>Damage inflicted by a mental grapple is based on the attacker's Wisdom bonus rather than Strength bonus. A mental grapple always inflicts <a href="CombatDamage.php#NonLethalDamage">non-lethal damage</a>.</li><li>Anyone in a mental grapple may not use their <a href="Combat.php#Dodge">Dodge</a> or <a href="Combat.php#Parry">Parry</a> values against any opponents, even the one they are mentally grappling, due to the distraction. They use their <a href="Combat.php#BaseDefense">Base Defense</a> instead.</li><li>Anyone involved in a mental grapple must make a <a href="Skills.php?Name=Concentration">Concentration</a> check (Difficulty 20) to do anything else without first escaping the mental grapple. A character can take a different standard action by forgoing the mental grapple check for that round, but then automatically loses the opposed mental grapple check for the round.</li><li>The winner of a mental grapple can choose to break off mental contact, even if another character established it.</li></ul>|
Normal Move|Move|Basic|The simplest move action is moving your speed. Many nonstandard modes of movement are also covered under this category, including climbing and swimming (up to one-quarter the character's speed), and crawling (up to 5 feet).|
Move All Out|Full|Basic|You can move all out as a full action. When you do so, you move up to four times your speed in a fairly straight line.</p><p>You can move all out for a number of rounds equal to 10 plus double your Constitution. After that, you must succeed at a Constitution check (Difficulty 10) to continue moving all out. You must check again each round, and the Difficulty increases by +1 for each check. When you fail a check, you become fatigued and must drop to an accelerated or normal pace.|
Overrun|Standard|Maneuver|As a standard action taken during your move, or as part of a <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Charge">charge</a>, you can attempt to overrun your target, moving through its square.</p><p>When you attempt to overrun a target, it can choose to avoid you, allowing you to pass through its square without requiring an attack. If your target does not avoid you, make a <a href="Combat.php#ManeuverBonus">combat maneuver roll</a> as normal. If your attempt is successful, you move through the target's space. If your attempt exceeds the Difficulty by 5 or more, you move through the target's space and the target is knocked <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Prone">prone</a>. If the target has more than two legs, add +2 to the Difficulty of the combat maneuver roll for each additional leg it has.|
Ready|Standard|Basic|Readying lets you prepare to take an action later, after you would normally act on your initiative, but before your initiative on your next turn. Readying is a standard action, so you can move as well.</p><p>You can ready a single <a href="CombatActions.php?Time=Standard">standard</a> or <a href="CombatActions.php?Time=Move">move</a> action. To do so, specify the action you will take and the circumstances under which you will take it. Then, any time before your next action, you may take the readied action as a reaction to those circumstances. For the rest of the fight, your initiative result is the count on which you took the readied action.</p><p>Your initiative result becomes the count on which you took the readied action. If you come to your next action and have not yet performed your readied action, you don't get to take the readied action (though you can ready the same action again).|
Recover|Full|Basic|You can spend <a href="BasicsConviction.php">Conviction</a> to use a full action to recover from damage in combat. One point of <a href="BasicsConviction.php">Conviction</a> allows you to make an immediate <a href="CombatDamage.php#Recovery">recovery check</a> as a full-round action.|
Speak|Free|Basic|In general, speaking is a free action. Some Narrators may limit the amount you can say during your turn, although characters can generally say quite a bit in the midst of combat, especially if they're tossing off witty quips. Issuing orders to followers in combat is a move action (<a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Command">Command</a>).|
Stand Up|Move|Basic|Standing up from a prone position requires a move action.|
Sunder|Standard|Maneuver|You can attempt to sunder an item held or worn by your opponent as part of a standard action. You must be wielding a weapon or possess the <a href="Feats.php?Name=Improved%20Strike">Improved Strike</a> feat to attempt a sunder.</p><p>Make a <a href="Combat.php#ManeuverBonus">combat maneuver check</a>. If your attempt is successful, you <a href="CombatDamage.php#Objects">deal damage to the item</a> normally.|
Total Defense|Standard|Basic|Instead of attacking, you can use your standard action to avoid attacks that round. You don't get to attack or perform any other standard action, but you get a +4 to both your <a href="Combat.php#Dodge">Dodge</a> and your <a href="Combat.php#Parry">Parry</a> for the round.|
Trip|Standard|Maneuver|You can attempt to trip an opponent as a standard action. You may use either your <a href="Combat.php#ManeuverBonus">maneuver bonus</a> or your <a href="Combat.php#AttackBonus">attack bonus</a> with the weapon you are using (if any) to make a trip attempt. If your attempt is successful, the target is knocked <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Prone">prone</a>. If your attempt fails by 10 or more, you are knocked <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Prone">prone</a> instead. If the target has more than two legs, add +2 to the Difficulty of the combat maneuver roll for each additional leg it has. Some creatures, such as oozes without legs and flying creatures, cannot be tripped.|.
