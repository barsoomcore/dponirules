Characters without Armor Training apply their armor's check penalty to all physical rolls and checks while wearing it, including <a href="Combat.php#AttackBonus">attack rolls</a> and <a href="Combat.php#ManeuverBonus">maneuver attempts</a>.

You don't know the subject's exact bonus unless it equals your own, only a rough estimate of relative ability. In cases of a 5-point or greater difference, the Narrator may choose to tell you the subject's bonus is considerably more or less than yours. If you lose the opposed roll, the Narrator should over- or under-estimate the subject's bonus.|You can get an idea of an opponent's combat bonus.

Blind-Fight|General||In melee combat, you suffer half the usual miss chance due to <a href="CombatModifiers.php?Name=Concealment">concealment</a>. If you spend a <a href="BasicsConviction.php">Conviction</a> point before rolling the miss chance, you automatically ignore it for that attack (you gain no other benefit from the <a href="BasicsConviction.php">Conviction</a> point). <br />You take only half the usual penalty to speed for being unable to see; darkness and poor visibility reduce your speed to three-quarters rather than half.|Half miss chance while in melee combat.
Canny Dodge|General||When unarmored and unencumbered, add your Intelligence or Wisdom score to your <a href="Combat.php#Dodge">Dodge</a>. Choose which bonus applies when you acquire this feat.

You lose your Canny Dodge bonus if you are wearing armor or carrying more than a light load.|Add your Int or Wis score to your <a href="Combat.php#Dodge">Dodge</a>.
Chakram Tricks|General|<a href="Feats.php?Name=Exotic%20Weapon%20Training">Exotic Weapon Training (chakram)</a>|You can use your <a href="EquipmentWeapons.php?Name=Chakram">chakram</a> to make trick shots, bouncing the chakram off available surfaces to strike opponents from directions they do not expect. This attack counts as a <a href="CombatModifiers.php?Name=Surprise%20Attack">surprise attack</a>, and can only be performed once against any given opponent. There must be available flat surfaces such as walls or pillars to make the attack with -- you cannot use this ability on an open field, for example. In addition, you may use the <a href="Feats.php?Name=Cleave">Cleave</a> feat with your <a href="EquipmentWeapons.php?Name=Chakram">chakram</a>. If you have the <a href="Feats.php?Name=Cleave">Cleave</a> feat, any time your <a href="EquipmentWeapons.php?Name=Chakram">chakram</a> attack knocks out, disables or kills your target, your <a href="EquipmentWeapons.php?Name=Chakram">chakram</a> carries on and makes another free attack against an opponent within ten feet of the original target. If no opponents are within this range, the chakram Cleave cannot be performed. <br />Finally, if you have <a href="Feats.php?Name=Improved%20Precise%20Shot">Improved Precise Shot</a> and Chakram Tricks, you ignore even total <a href="CombatModifiers.php?Name=Cover">cover</a> -- as long as there is a clear path sufficient for the chakram to travel, you can attack targets who have total cover. They do have total <a href="CombatModifiers.php?Name=Concealment">concealment</a>, however, and so the 50% miss chance applies to all such attacks.|Make trick shots and combos with your <a href="EquipmentWeapons.php?Name=Chakram">chakram</a>.
Challenge|General||Choose a specific <a href="BasicsChecks.php#Challenges">Challenge</a>. You can pick a standard <a href="BasicsChecks.php#Challenges">Challenge</a> or one from any skill's individual description. For standard challenges, the challenge only applies to a specific task. So, for example, if you choose the <a href="BasicsChecks.php#Challenges">Fast Task Challenge</a>, you need to specify a task, such as the feint application of <a href="Skills.php?Name=Bluff">Bluff</a>, or making an item with <a href="Skills.php?Name=Craft">Craft</a>. If you take <a href="BasicsChecks.php#Challenges">Simultaneous Tasks</a>, you need to specify the two tasks. Once specified, these things do not change.<br /> You can perform the challenge chosen under this feat with a 5-point lesser modifier than usual. So, for challenges with a -5 penalty or a +5 Difficulty, you perform them like normal checks. For challenges with a greater modifier, you reduce the modifier accordingly. So a hero with Fast Feint, for example, can <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Feint">feint in combat as a move action</a> with no <a href="Skills.php?Name=Bluff">Bluff</a> check modifier (since the normal modifier is -5).<br /> You can take this feat multiple times. Each time, it applies to a different challenge.|Perform a particular <a href="BasicsChecks.php#Challenges">Challenge</a> with no modifier.
Chokehold|Warrior||If you <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Grapple">pin an opponent while grappling</a>, you can apply a chokehold, causing your opponent to begin <a href="PlayingHazards.php#Suffocation">suffocating</a> for as long as you maintain the pin.|Cause a <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Pinned">pinned</a> opponent to <a href="PlayingHazards.php#Suffocation">suffocate</a>.

You can't move before making this extra attack. The extra attack is with the same weapon and <a href="Combat.php#AttackBonus">attack bonus</a> as the attack that downed your previous opponent. You can use this feat once per round.|Get an extra melee attack when you take out an opponent.
Connected|General||You know people who can help you out from time to time. You can call in favors by making a <a href="Skills.php?Name=Diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> check. It might be advice, information, help with a legal matter, or access to resources. The Narrator sets the Difficulty of the <a href="Skills.php?Name=Diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> check, based on the aid required. A simple favor is Difficulty 10, ranging up to Difficulty 25 or higher for especially difficult, dangerous, or expensive favors. You can spend a <a href="BasicsConviction.php">Conviction</a> point to automatically secure the favor. The Narrator has the right to veto any request if it is too involved or likely to spoil the plot of the adventure.

Contacts|General||You have such extensive and well-informed contacts that you can make a <a href="Skills.php?Name=Gather%20Information">Gather Information</a> check in only one minute, assuming you have some means of getting in touch with your contacts.

Wind Finesse|Adept|<a href="Powers.php?Name=Elemental%20Blast">Elemental Blast</a>, <a href="Powers.php?Name=Wind%20Shaping">Wind Shaping</a>|You have developed your control over the wind into a true art, allowing you to create multiple wind speeds and directions in the same area, as well as localized wind effects with specific targets. You may perform new techniques of finesse when using your <a href="Powers.php?Name=Wind%20Shaping">Wind Shaping</a> power. The listed Difficulties assume light winds are prevalent, though in stronger winds the Difficulty decreases. Some examples include, but aren't limited to: <br /><em>Catch the Falling:</em> You may use winds to create a cushion of wind, allowing someone or something that is falling to land safely. You must generate a Windstorm to do this for Small targets, Hurricane-Force Wind for Medium targets, and a Tornado for Large targets. You may also attempt to reverse the direction of their fall, hurling them up into the sky. This requires that you beat the Difficulty of your <a href="Powers.php?Name=Wind%20Shaping">Wind Shaping</a> check by 5. <a href="Skills.php?Name=Perform">Perform</a>ing this action out of turn increases the Difficulty by +5. Catching multiple objects/creatures increases the Difficulty by +2 per additional object/creature. <br /><em>Dust Devil (Difficulty 35): </em>You can create a miniature tornado which you can direct to attack your opponents. You can bring one dust devil into creation by creating Hurricane-Force Winds. For every 5 points by which you exceed the Difficulty to create Hurricane-Force Winds, you may create another dust devil. The target must succeed a Reflex or Fortitude save to avoid or resist an attacking dust devil. If the target fails their save, they are sucked within and whirled around for 1-4 rounds, taking +4 damage per round, before being violently expelled (falling damage may apply). While the subject is within the dust devil, you may move them up to 100 feet per round trapped. If you do not maintain the dust devils or fail a <a href="Skills.php?Name=Concentration">Concentration</a> check due to distraction, they move about randomly (and are liable to suck up friends or bystanders). <br /><em>Flying (Difficulty 25 for one person):</em> You may create winds beneath a person which allow them to fly. You must create Severe Winds to propel one person, a Windstorm to propel six people, and a Hurricane to propel a dozen people. You gain a +2 bonus on the power check if you use a suitably lightweight object with a large surface area, such as a kite or a carpet. This is a maintained use of <a href="Powers.php?Name=Wind%20Shaping">Wind Shaping</a>. <br /><em>Protective Whirlwind (Difficulty 30):</em> You can create a wall of rotating wind around an area or person that protects any within from ranged fire. You must create a Windstorm in order to establish the protective whirlwind. Ranged weapon attacks are impossible, and everyone within the whirlwind gains <a href="CombatModifiers.php?Name=Concealment">concealment</a> against melee attacks and partial <a href="CombatModifiers.php?Name=Concealment">concealment</a> against siege weapons. Adepts using <a href="Powers.php?Name=Elemental%20Blast">Elemental Blast</a> must beat you in an opposed <a href="Powers.php?Name=Wind%20Shaping">Wind Shaping</a> check. This is a maintained use of <a href="Powers.php?Name=Wind%20Shaping">Wind Shaping</a>. <br /><em>Volley of Arrows (Difficulty 30): </em>Though you cannot manipulate an object, you may cause projectiles, such as arrows or sling stones to hurtle through the air. By creating a Windstorm, you can cause up to a dozen arrows to fire. These arrows travel in a general direction, but cannot be given a specific target; each target in the area will be struck by at least one arrow -- possibly more, if it is a large target.<p>If there are more or fewer targets than arrows in the area of effect, targets are determined randomly. Make a normal ranged attack check, using your Intelligence in place of Dexterity, with a -4 penalty due to the difficulty in controlling such a fine object with mighty winds. The <a href="EquipmentWeapons.php?Name=Bow">arrows</a> deal their normal damage. For every 5 points by which you exceed the Difficulty to create a Windstorm, you may double the amount of arrows you can unleash. If you fail your <a href="Powers.php?Name=Wind%20Shaping">Wind Shaping</a> check by 5 or more, you lose control of the winds. The winds may be unleashed on the entire area, or a more specific Narrator-determined backlash might occur.|You can use <a href="Powers.php?Name=Wind%20Shaping">Wind Shaping</a> more skillfully.
Wind Stance|General|Dex +3 or higher, <a href="Combat.php#CombatBonus">combat bonus</a> +4 or higher|If you take at least one <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Normal%20Move">normal move action</a> this round, you gain <a href="CombatModifiers.php?Name=Concealment">concealment</a>.
