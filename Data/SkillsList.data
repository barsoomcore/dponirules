Acrobatics|Dex|Yes|Armor||||You can flip, dive, roll and perform other acrobatic maneuvers.|You can make an Acrobatics check (Difficulty 5) to lessen the damage from a fall. Subtract the amount your roll exceeds the Difficulty (in feet) from the distance of a fall before determining damage. For example, an Acrobatics check of 20 (15 more than the Difficulty) reduces the effective distance of a fall by 15 feet. A fall reduced to 0 feet does no damage. You can make an Acrobatics check (Difficulty 25) to move through a space occupied by an opponent or obstacle (moving over, under, or around). A failed roll means you don't get past the obstacle. <br /><i>Balancing:</i> You can walk on a precarious surface. A successful check lets you move  half your speed along the surface as a move action. A failure indicates you spends your move action just keeping your balance and do not move. A failure by 5 or more indicates you fall. The Difficulty is based on the surface. You cannot use your <a href="Combat.php#Dodge">Dodge</a> while balancing. If you take any damage while balancing, you must make another Acrobatics check to avoid falling.</p><table width="50%"><th>Surface</th><th class="center">Difficulty</th><tr class="odd-row"><td>More than 12 inches wide</td><td class="center">5</td></tr><tr><td>7-12 in. wide</td><td class="center">10</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td>2-6 in. wide</td><td class="center">15</td></tr><tr><td>Less than 2 in. wide</td><td class="center">20</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td>Uneven or angled</td><td class="center">+5</td></tr><tr class="last-row"><td>Slippery surface</td><td class="center">+5</td></tr></table><p><i>Avoiding Being Tripped:</i> You can  add your Acrobatics bonus to your Combat bonus to determine the Difficulty of a <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Trip">trip attack</a> made against you (as opposed to your <a href="Combat.php#ManeuverBonus">Maneuver Bonus</a>, as normal). You cannot use Acrobatics to <em>make</em> a <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Trip">trip attack</a>, however.</p><p><i><a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Feint">Feint</a>:</i> You can make an Acrobatics check to <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Feint">feint in combat</a>.</p><p><i>Instant Up:</i> You can make an Acrobatics check (Difficulty 20) to <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Stand%20Up">stand up from a prone position</a> as a free action rather than a move action.</p><p><i>Performance:</i> You can use Acrobatics as if it were the <a href="Skills.php?Name=Perform">Perform</a> skill to impress an audience.</p><p><i>Acrobatic Charge:</i> You can turn, tumble or swing from ropes as part of a <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Charge">charge action</a> with a successful Acrobatics check (Difficulty 15). And you should do so as often as you can.|<i>Accelerated Acrobatics:</i> You can try to cross a precarious surface faster than normal. If you increase the Difficulty by 5, you can move your full speed as a move action. Moving twice your speed in a round requires the penalty plus two skill checks, one for each move action. You can also accept this penalty to <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Charge">charge</a> across a precarious surface; this requires one skill check per multiple of your speed (or fraction thereof) that you <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Charge">charge</a>.</p><p><i>Perfect Balance:</i> In return for increasing the Difficulty of your Acrobatics check by 5, you move with such grace and agility that you can still use your <a href="Combat.php#Dodge">Dodge</a> while balancing.</p><p><i>Perilous Balance:</i> You can shake or disturb the surface on which you are balancing (e.g., swaying on a tightrope). If your check succeeds after increasing the Difficulty by 5, you keep your balance and impose a +5 modifier on the Difficulty of all Acrobatics checks others must make on the surface until the next round.|No.|You can try to reduce damage from a fall as a reaction once per fall. Balancing while moving one-half your speed is a move action. Accelerated movement, allowing you to balance while moving your full speed, is also a move action.|The balancing aspects of Acrobatics can be used untrained.
Bluff|Cha|||Interaction|||Bluff is the skill of making the outlandish seem credible. It covers acting, fast-talking, trickery, and subterfuge.|A Bluff check is opposed by the target's Bluff or <a href="Skills.php?Name=Sense%20Motive">Sense Motive</a> check, whichever is higher (it's harder to bluff someone who knows all the tricks). Favorable and unfavorable circumstances weigh heavily on the outcome of a bluff. Two circumstances can work against you: the bluff is hard to believe, or the action the bluff requires goes against the target's self-interest, nature, or orders.<br />If it's important, the Narrator can distinguish between the two. For instance, if the target gets a +10 bonus because the bluff demands something risky, and the target's <a href="Skills.php?Name=Sense%20Motive">Sense Motive</a> check succeeds by 10 or less, then the target didn't so much see through the bluff as prove reluctant to go along with it. If the target's <a href="Skills.php?Name=Sense%20Motive">Sense Motive</a> check succeeds by 11 or more, he sees through the bluff, and would have even if it had not placed any unusual demands on him (that is, even without the +10 bonus). <br />A successful Bluff check indicates the target reacts as you want, at least for a short time (usually 1 round or less), or the target believes something you want him to believe.</p><table width="50%"><th>Example Circumstances</th><th class="center"><a href="Skills.php?Name=Sense Motive">Sense Motive</a> Modifier</th><tr class="odd-row"><td>The target wants to believe the character.</td><td class="center">-5</td></tr><tr><td>The bluff is believable and doesn't affect the target much one way or the other.</td><td class="center">+0</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td>The bluff is a little hard to believe or puts the target  at some kind of risk.</td><td class="center">+5</td></tr><tr><td>The bluff is hard to believe or entails a large risk  for the target.</td><td class="center">+10</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td>The bluff is way out there; it's almost too incredible  to consider.</td><td class="center">+20</td></tr></table><p><i>Diversion:</i> You can use Bluff to help you hide. A successful Bluff check gives you the diversion needed to attempt a <a href="Skills.php?Name=Stealth">Stealth</a> check while people are aware of you.</p><p><i><a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Feint">Feint</a>:</i> You can make a Bluff check to <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Feint">feint in combat</a>.</p><p><i>Innuendo:</i> You can use Bluff to send secret messages while talking about other things. The Difficulty for a basic message is 10. Complex messages have Difficulties of 15 or 20. The recipient of the message, and anyone listening in, makes a Bluff or <a href="Skills.php?Name=Sense%20Motive">Sense Motive</a> check against the same Difficulty to understand your message. Whether trying to send or understand a message, a failure by 5 or more points means the receiver misinterprets the message in some fashion.|<i>Conversational Paralysis:</i> In return for a -5 penalty to your Bluff check, a successful check dazes your target for one round. Your claims are so outlandish the target can do nothing but sputter or reel in confusion. This skill challenge does not work in combat situations. Each additional -5 check penalty you accept increases the duration of the effect by one round.</p><p><i>Durable Lie:</i> In return for a -5 penalty on your check, your target believes your bluff longer than usual. The target continues to act as you wish for an additional round. You can apply another -5 penalty to extend this to two rounds. This challenge does not work with the feint use of Bluff.|Generally, a failed Bluff check makes the target too suspicious to try again in the same circumstances. For feinting in combat, you may try again freely.|A bluff takes at least a full round, but can take much longer if you try something elaborate. Using Bluff as a <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Feint">feint in combat</a> is a standard action, as is using Bluff to create a diversion to hide.||
Climb|Str||Armor||||You're skilled in scaling angled and uneven surfaces.|With each successful Climb check, you can move up, down, or across a slope, wall, or other steep incline at one-quarter your normal speed. The Difficulty of the check depends on the conditions of the climb. If the climb is less than 10 feet, reduce the Difficulty by 5.<br />A failed Climb check means you make no progress, and a check that fails by 5 or more means you fall from whatever height you attained (unless you are secured with some kind of harness or other equipment).<br />If you fall, make a Climb check (Difficulty equal to climb's Difficulty + 20). Success means you arrest your fall about halfway and suffer no damage.<br />It's somewhat easier to catch someone else who falls, assuming they are within arm's reach. Make a Climb check (Difficulty equal to climb's Difficulty +10) to do so. If you fail the check, you do not catch the other person. If you fail by 5 or more, you fall as well.</p><table width="75%"><th width="15%" class="center">Difficulty</th><th>Example Wall or Surface or Task</th><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">0</td><td>A slope too steep to walk up.<tr><td class="center">5</td><td>A knotted rope with a wall to brace against.</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">10</td><td>A rope with a wall to brace against.

Any time you take damage while climbing, make a Climb check against the Difficulty of the climb. Failure means you fall.|<i>Accelerated Climb:</i> You can try to climb more quickly than normal. By accepting a +5 Difficulty modifier to your check, you can move half your speed instead of one-quarter your speed while climbing. You can accept this challenge twice, for a total Difficulty modifier of +10, to move at your normal speed while climbing.</p><p><i>Fighting Climb:</i> You can accept a +5 Difficulty modifier to a Climb check to use your <a href="Combat.php#Dodge">Dodge</a> while climbing.</p><p><i>Secured Climb:</i> If you take a +5 Difficulty modifier to your Climb check, you do not have to make a Climb check to maintain your position if you take damage. You climb in such a way as to brace yourself for any attacks.||Climbing is a move action.|Someone using a rope can haul a character up (or lower a character down) by sheer strength. Use a character's carrying capacity to determine how much weight he can lift in this way.
Concentration|Wis||||||You can focus your mind and concentrate despite distractions.|Make a Concentration check whenever you might be distracted (by damage, harsh weather, and so on). If the check succeeds, you may continue what you are doing. If the check fails, the action you're attempting also fails. The check Difficulty depends on the nature of the distraction.</p><table width="75%"><th>Distraction</th><th width="30%" class="center">Difficulty</th><tr class="odd-row"><td>Damaged during the action</td><td>10 + damage bonus</td></tr><tr><td>Taking continuous damage during the action</td><td>10 + half of continuous damage bonus last dealt</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td>Vigorous motion (bouncy vehicle ride, small boat in rough water, belowdecks  in a storm-tossed ship, riding a horse)</td><td class="center">10</td></tr><tr><td>Violent motion (very rough vehicle ride, small boat in rapids, on deck  of storm-tossed ship, galloping horse)</td><td class="center">15</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td>Extraordinarily violent motion (earthquake)</td><td class="center">20</td></tr><tr><td>Bound, grappling or pinned</td><td class="center">20</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td>Weather is a high wind carrying blinding rain or sleet</td><td class="center">5</td></tr><tr><td>Weather is wind-driven hail, dust, or debris</td><td class="center">10</td></tr></table><p><i>Concentrating on Powers:</i> Using or maintaining various supernatural powers often requires Concentration checks, particularly when distracted.

Craft|Int|Yes|||Yes|Yes|Craft is actually a number of separate skills involving arts and crafts. You must choose a specialty, such as blacksmithing, brewing, mad science, ninja gear, poison-crafting, small arms, or textiles. Training in one Craft specialty does not provide skill in other specialties. Note that Craft (mechanics) is actually <a href="Skills.php?Name=Disable%20Device">Disable Device</a>.|Craft skills are specifically focused on making things. To use a Craft skill effectively, you must have an appropriate set of tools.</p><p><i>Making Items:</i> The Difficulty, time, and resources required to make an item depend on its complexity. Make a <a href="EquipmentWealth.php">Wealth check</a> against the Wealth Difficulty to acquire the necessary raw materials, and then make your Craft check. (Example Difficulties are given in the table.) If your Craft check succeeds, you make the item. If the Craft check fails, you do not produce a usable end result, and any raw materials are wasted. This use of Craft cannot be performed during a scene; the normal amount of time that must pass before completion is listed below.</p><table class="last-row" width="75%"><th style="padding-right: 0.5em">Complexity</th><th style="padding-right: 0.5em" class="center">Craft<br />Difficulty</th><th style="padding-right: 0.5em" class="center">Wealth<br />Difficulty</th><th style="padding-right: 0.5em">Time</th><th>Examples</th><tr class="odd-row"><td>Simple</td><td class="center">15</td><td class="center">5</td><td>1 hr.</td><td>garment, household item</tr><tr><td>Moderate</td><td class="center">20</td><td class="center">10</td><td>12 hrs.</td><td>fine garment, lock, weapon</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td>Complex</td><td class="center">25</td><td class="center">15</td><td>24 hrs.</td><td>plate armor, mechanism</td></tr><tr><td>Advanced</td><td class="center">30</td><td class="center">20</td><td>60 hrs.</td><td>building, vehicle</td></tr></table><p><i>Repairing:</i> You can use Craft skills to repair damaged items. In general, simple repairs have a Difficulty of 10 to 15 and require no more than a few minutes to accomplish. More complex repair work has a Difficulty of 20 or higher and cannot be completed in the current scene without taking the Fast Task challenge. The repairs have a cost 5 lower than making the item (negligible for simple items).</p><p><i>Forgery:</i> Characters can use Craft to produce forgeries in their areas of specialty. The result of the Craft check becomes the Difficulty for a <a href="Skills.php?Name=Notice">Notice</a> check to detect the forgery. The Narrator can modify either the Craft or <a href="Skills.php?Name=Notice">Notice</a> check based on the conditions and the characters' familiarity with the original subject.</p><p><i>Reload:</i> Reloading a <a href="EquipmentWeapons.php?Name=Flintlock">flintlock pistol</a> is a full-round Craft (small arms) check with a Difficulty of 10.</p><p><i>Jury-Rigged Items:</i> You can use this skill to create temporary or crude items. Make a Craft check as normal, but do not make a <a href="EquipmentWealth.php">Wealth</a> check. In addition, it only takes a full-round action to create a Simple item and one minute to create a Moderate item. The final item has no sale value, and there is a 10% chance (a roll of 19 or higher on a d20) per hour of use that it breaks. You can't jury-rig an item with a purchase difficulty of more than 14. You must provide appropriate raw materials and tools as normal.|<i>Fast Craft:</i> You may add +5 or +10 to the indicated Difficulty to craft an item. This increase allows you to make the item faster than usual, reducing the time to half or one-quarter normal, respectively.</p><p><i>Masterwork:</i> By increasing Difficulty and cost by +5, you can make a masterwork item. These items are especially well made and provide a +1 bonus when used. For more information on masterwork weapons and armor, see <a href="Equipment.php">Equipment</a>.|Yes, although in some cases the Narrator may decide a failed attempt to repair an item has a negative effect, preventing further attempts.|The time to make something varies depending on its complexity, as shown in the table. The Narrator may increase or decrease the time for a particular Craft project as necessary.|Generally, you can take 10 when using a Craft skill, but can't take 20 since doing so represents multiple attempts, and you use up raw materials with each attempt. You can take 10 or take 20 on repair checks. If you don't have the proper tools, you take a -4 penalty on Craft checks.|
Diplomacy|Cha|||Yes|||You're skilled in dealing with people, from proper etiquette and social graces to a way with words and public speaking. Use this skill to convince people to do what you want them to do, or to just make them friendly towards you.|You can convince people to accept your offers and suggestions with a successful Diplomacy check. There are two main uses of Diplomacy: Bargaining and Befriending.<p><i>Bargaining:</i> You can propose a trade or agreement to another creature with your words; a Diplomacy check can then persuade them that accepting it is a good idea. Either side of the deal may involve physical goods, money, services, promises, or abstract concepts like "satisfaction." The Difficulty for the Diplomacy check is based on three factors: who the target is, the relationship between the target and the character making the check, and the risk vs. reward factor of the deal proposed.</p><p>If the Diplomacy check beats the Difficulty, the subject accepts the proposal, with no changes or with minor (mostly idiosyncratic) changes. If the check fails by 5 or less, the subject does not accept the deal but may, at the DM's option, present a counter-offer that would push the deal up one place on the risk-vs.-reward list. For example, a counter-offer might make an Even deal Favorable for the subject. The character who made the Diplomacy check can simply accept the counter-offer, if they choose; no further check will be required. If the check fails by 10 or more, the Diplomacy is over; the subject will entertain no further deals, and may become hostile or take other steps to end the conversation.</p><p class="notation">Base Difficulty = 10 + level + Wisdom</p><p>The base Difficulty for any Diplomacy check is equal to the 10 + level of the highest-level character in the group that you are trying to influence + the Wisdom modifier of the character in the group with the highest Wisdom. For this purpose, a number of characters is only a "group" if they are committed to all following the same course of action. Either one NPC is in charge, or they agree to act by consensus. If each member is going to make up their mind on their own, roll separate Diplomacy checks against each.</p><p>The Difficulty of the Diplomacy check is modified by the character's relationship with the other party:</p><table><th width="10%" class="center">Modifier</th><th width="15%">Relationship</th><th>Description</th><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">-10</td><td>Intimate</td><td>Someone who with whom you have an implicit trust. Example: A lover or spouse.</td><tr><td class="center">-5</td><td>Ally</td><td>Someone on the same team, but with whom you have no personal relationship. Example: A cleric of the same religion or a knight serving the same king.</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">+0</td><td>Indifferent</td><td>No relationship whatsoever. Example: A guard at a castle or a traveler on a road.</td></tr><tr><td class="center">+5</td><td>Enemy</td><td>Someone on an opposed team, with whom you have no personal relationship. Example: A cleric of a philosophically-opposed religion or an orc bandit who is robbing you.</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">+10</td><td>Nemesis</td><td>Someone who has sworn to do you, personally, harm. Example: The brother of a man you murdered in cold blood.</td></tr></table><p>This relationship modifier may be further modified by -2 or +2 for characters that have some particular reason to be favourably or unfavourably inclined towards the hero, but perhaps haven't changed their basic relationship. For example: an Imperial agent the heroes spared the life of might still be an Enemy, but the normal +5 might be reduced to a +3 in that case.</p><p>The Difficulty is further modified by the risk and the reward the proposed deal offers:</p><table><th width="10%" class="center">Modifier</th><th width="15%">Risk/Reward</th><th>Description</th><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">-10</td><td>Fantastic</td><td>The reward for accepting the deal is very worthwhile, and the risk is either acceptable or extremely unlikely. The best-case scenario is a virtual guarantee. Example: An offer to pay a lot of gold for something of no value to the subject, such as information that is not a secret.</td></tr><tr><td class="center">-5</td><td>Favorable</td><td>The reward is good, and the risk is tolerable. If all goes according to plan, the deal will end up benefiting the subject. Example: A request to aid the party in battle against a weak goblin tribe in return for a cut of the money and first pick of the magic items.</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">+0</td><td>Even</td><td>The reward and risk are more or less even, or the deal involves neither reward nor risk. Example: A request for directions to someplace that is not a secret.</td></tr><tr><td class="center">+5</td><td>Unfavorable</td><td>The reward is not enough compared to the risk involved; even if all goes according to plan, chances are it will end up badly for the subject. Example: A request to free a prisoner the subject is guarding (for which he or she will probably be fired) in return for a small amount of money.</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">+10</td><td>Horrible</td><td>There is no conceivable way the proposed plan could end up with the subject ahead, or the worst-case scenario is guaranteed to occur. Example: A offer to trade a bit of dirty string for a castle.</td></tr></table><p>Note that if the character wishes to lie about the deal being offered, a <a href="Skills.php?Name=Bluff">Bluff</a> check is required. In negotiations, all participants roll opposed Diplomacy checks to see who gets the advantage. Opposed checks also resolve cases where two advocates plead opposing cases before a third party.</p><p><i>Befriending:</i> Diplomacy can influence a character's attitude over time, and make them friendlier towards you. The Narrator chooses the character's initial attitude based on circumstances. Most of the time, people the heroes meet are indifferent toward them, but a specific situation may call for a different initial attitude.</p><p>To adjust your relationship with another character, you must make FOUR successful Diplomacy checks against them. The Difficulty of these checks is equal to a normal bargaining use of Diplomacy, so it's 15 plus the target's level, plus their Wisdom, plus the relationship modifier, plus any appropriate modifiers for the deal (if you can demonstrate an advantage to them becoming more friendly with you, or on the flip side, if you're a jerk). After four successes, the target's relationship with you improves by one category (you can't improve someone who's Intimate with you already). If you succeed on the check by more than 10, you gain two successes on that attempt.</p><p>You may only make one befriending check against a given target per scene, and such a check requires spending at least an hour with the target (although you can be doing other things during that time). If your last befriending attempt against this target was successful, you gain a +2 bonus on the check. On the other hand, if your last attempt was unsuccessful, you suffer a -2 penalty on the check.</p><p>If you fail twice at befriending checks before you succeed four times, the target's relationship with you goes DOWN one level. A failure by more than 10 immediately moves the target's relationship with you down one level. Note that if you are attempting to befriend someone under false pretenses (i.e. you want something from them beyond friendship), you must make a <a href="Skills.php?Name=Bluff">Bluff</a> check prior to each Diplomacy check or else the befriending attempt automatically fails.|<i>Combat Diplomacy:</i> You can make a Diplomacy check in combat as a full-round action by accepting a +10 modifier to the Difficulty. Opponents in combat with you are considered enemies. An indifferent opponent doesn't attack you unless you give him reason to do so. Allied foes stop fighting altogether, and, well, you're not likely to make anyone Intimate during combat.|Generally, trying again doesn't work. Even if the initial check succeeds, the other character can only be persuaded so far. If the initial check fails, the other character has probably become more firmly committed to his position, and trying again is futile. At the Narrator's discretion, you can try again when the situation changes in some way: you find a new approach to your argument, new evidence appears, and so forth.|Diplomacy is at least a full-round action. The Narrator may determine some negotiations require a longer period of time, perhaps much longer.||
Disable Device|Int|Yes||||Yes|You are skilled at working with mechanical devices, including locks and traps.|All uses of the <a href="Skills.php?Name=Craft">Craft</a> skill apply to Disable Device, including Making Items, Repairing and Jury-Rigged Items. In addition, Disable Device can be used for the following purposes:</p><p><i>Open Lock:</i> You can pick locks. You must have thieves' tools. The Difficulty depends on the quality of the lock.</p><table class="last-row" width="300px"><th>Lock Quality</th><th class="center">Difficulty</th><tr class="odd-row"><td>Simple</td><td class="center">20</td></tr><tr><td>Average</td><td class="center">25 </td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td>Good</td><td class="center">30</td></tr><tr><td>Amazing</td><td class="center">40</td></tr></table><p><i>Traps and Sabotage:</i> Disabling a simple mechanical device has a Difficulty of 10. More intricate and complex devices have higher Difficulties. The Narrator rolls the check. If the check succeeds, you disable the device. If the check fails by 4 or less, you have failed but can try again. If you fail by 5 or more, something goes wrong. If it's a trap, you set if off. If it's some sort of sabotage, you think that the device is disabled, but it's not. You can rig simple devices to work normally for a while and then fail later, if you choose.</p><p><i>Improvise Traps:</i> You can use Disable Device to set up quick deadfalls or breakaway items, if your Narrator agrees. As a full-round action, you can make a Disable Device check to set up an improvised trap out of nearby materials. If you are being observed, you must make a <a href="Skills.php?Name=Bluff">Bluff</a> check to conceal your intentions. When an enemy enters the location of the trap, you can trigger it, dealing damage according to your Disable Device check. A check result of at least 20 is required for the trap to deal any damage at all. A check that exceeds 20 deals +2 damage, with the damage rising by +1 for every 5 points by which the check exceeds 20. The victim of the trap is allowed a Reflex save against a DC equal to 10 + half your Disable Device ranks to halve the damage. You do not need tools for this use of Disable Device.|<i>Hide Tampering:</i> If you add +5 to your Difficulty, you can conceal any tampering with a device. Anyone who inspects the device must make a <a href="Skills.php?Name=Notice">Notice</a> check against your Disable Device check result to notice your tampering. On a failed check, it goes unnoticed.|Yes, though you must be aware you have failed in order to try again.|Disabling a simple device is a full-round action. Intricate or complex devices require multiple rounds at the Narrator's discretion.|You can take 10 when making a Disable Device check. You can take 20 to open a lock or to disable a device, unless trying to prevent your tampering from being noticed, but if there is a consequence for failure (such as setting off a trap), you automatically suffer it.</p><p>If you do not have the proper tools, you take a -4 penalty on your check.|
Disguise|Cha|||||Yes|You can use makeup, costumes, and other props to change your appearance.|Your Disguise check determines the effectiveness of your disguise. It is opposed by others' <a href="Skills.php?Name=Notice">Notice</a> checks. Make one Disguise check even if several people make <a href="Skills.php?Name=Notice">Notice</a> checks. The Narrator makes the Disguise check secretly so you are not sure exactly how well your disguise will hold up under scrutiny.</p><p>If you don't draw any attention to yourself, however, others don't get to make <a href="Skills.php?Name=Notice">Notice</a> checks. If you come to the attention of people who are suspicious, they get to make a <a href="Skills.php?Name=Notice">Notice</a> check. (The Narrator can assume suspicious observers take 10 on their <a href="Skills.php?Name=Notice">Notice</a> checks.)</p><p>The effectiveness of your disguise depends in part on how much you attempt to change your appearance.</p><table width="40%" class="last-row"><th>Disguise</th><th>Modifier</th><tr class="odd-row"><td>Minor details only</td><td class="center">+5</td></tr><tr><td>Appropriate uniform or costume</td><td class="center">+2</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td>Disguised as different sex</td><td class="center">-2</td></tr><tr><td>Disguised as different age category</td><td class="center">-2</td></tr></table><p>If you are impersonating a particular individual, those who know the subject automatically get to make <a href="Skills.php?Name=Notice">Notice</a> checks.

If you casually meet many different people, each for a short time, the Narrator checks once per day or hour using an average <a href="Skills.php?Name=Notice">Notice</a> modifier for the group (assuming they take 10).|<i>Face in the Crowd:</i> With a -5 penalty to your check result, you can craft a disguise that is less likely to draw attention. Only people who specifically single you out and try to notice your deception receive <a href="Skills.php?Name=Notice">Notice</a> checks to do so. Guards and other passive observers take no special notice of you unless you draw attention to yourself or interact directly with them.</p><p><i>Quick Change:</i> You can adopt a disguise as a full-round action by taking a -5 penalty to your check. However, anyone who comes within one visual range increment of you (usually 10 feet) automatically sees through your disguise due to its makeshift nature.|No, though you can assume the same disguise again at a later time. If others saw through the previous disguise, they are automatically treated as suspicious if you assume the same disguise again.|A disguise requires at least 10 minutes of preparation. The Narrator makes <a href="Skills.php?Name=Notice">Notice</a> checks for those who encounter you immediately upon meeting you and again each hour or day thereafter, depending on circumstances.|If you don't have any makeup, costumes, or props, you take a -4 penalty on Disguise checks. 
Escape Artist|Dex||Armor||||You're trained in escaping from bonds and other restraints.|Make a check to escape from restraints or to squeeze through a tight space.</p><table width="50%"><th>Restraint</th><th>Difficulty</th><tr class="odd-row"><td>Ropes</td><td>Opponent's Dexterity +20</td></tr><tr><td>Tight space</td><td>30</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td><a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Grapple">Grapple</a></td><td>Opponent's <a href="Combat.php#Parry">Parry</a></td></tr></table><p><i>Tight Spaces:</i> For a tight space, a check is only called for if your head fits but your shoulders don't. If the space is longer than your height, such as a chimney, the Narrator may call for multiple checks. You can't fit through a space your head doesn't fit through. You can also reach through a tight space that your hand fits through but your arm normally does not by making an Escape Artist check.</p><p><i>Escaping Grapples:</i> You can make an Escape Artist check to get out of a <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Grapple">grapple</a> or out of a <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Pinned">pinned</a> condition (so you are just being <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Grappled">grappled</a>). Doing so is a standard action, so if you escape the <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Grapple">grapple</a> you can move in the same round. The Difficulty is the same for a normal <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Grapple">grapple</a> check (opponent's <a href="Combat.php#Parry">Parry</a>)|<i>Conceal Efforts:</i> In exchange for a +5 to the Difficulty, you can conceal your efforts to escape. Anyone who inspects your bindings must make a <a href="Skills.php?Name=Notice">Notice</a> check with a Difficulty equal to your Escape Artist check result. If the <a href="Skills.php?Name=Notice">Notice</a> check fails, they do not notice your efforts to escape. So, for example, you could leave your bonds apparently in place so a villain doesn't realize that you're actually free.|You can make another check after a failed check if you are squeezing through a tight space. If the situation permits, you can make additional checks as long as you are not being actively opposed.|Making a check to escape from being bound by ropes or other restraints requires 1 minute. Escaping a <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Grapple">grapple</a> is a standard action. Squeezing or reaching through a tight space takes at least 1 minute, maybe longer, depending on the distance.||
Gather Information|Cha|||Yes|||You know how to make contacts, collect gossip and rumors, question informants, and otherwise gather information from people.|By succeeding at a skill check (Difficulty 10) you can get a feel for the major news and rumors in an area. This assumes no obvious reasons exist why information would be withheld. The higher the check result, the more complete the information. Information ranges from general to protected, and the Difficulty increases accordingly for the type of information you want to gather, as given in the table below.</p><table width="40%" class="last-row"><th>Type of Information</th><th class="center">Difficulty</th><tr class="odd-row"><td>General</td><td class="center">10</td></tr><tr><td>Specific</td><td class="center">15</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td>Restricted</td><td class="center">20</td></tr><tr><td>Protected</td><td class="center">25</td></tr></table><p>General information concerns local happenings, rumors, gossip, and the like. Specific information usually relates to a particular question. Restricted information includes facts that aren't generally known and require you to locate someone who has access to such information. Protected information is even harder to come by and might involve some danger, either for the one asking the questions or the one providing the answers.</p><p>There's a chance someone takes note of anyone asking about restricted or protected information. The Narrator decides when this is the case. In some situations, opposed Gather Information checks are appropriate to see if someone else notices your inquiries (and you notice theirs).</p><p><i>Send Message:</i> You can send a message to a particular individual through a Gather Information check.

You increase your Gather Information check Difficulty by +5, but you avoid leaving any clues about the information you seek. If your check fails, you may be detected as normal, but you still avoid spreading clues about what you seek.|Yes, but it takes additional time for each check, and you may draw attention to yourself if you repeatedly pursue a certain type of information.|A Gather Information check takes at least an hour, possibly several, at the Narrator's discretion. Normally Gather Information checks take place between scenes.||
Handle Animal|Cha||||||You know how to handle, care for, and train various types of animals.|The time required to get an effect and the Difficulty depend on what you are trying to do.</p><table width="50%" class="last-row"><th>Task</th><th class="center">Time</th><th class="center">Difficulty</th><tr class="odd-row"><td>Handle an animal</td><td>Move action</td><td class="center">10</td></tr><tr><td>"Push" an animal</td><td>Full-round action</td><td class="center">25</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td>Teach an animal a trick</td><td>1 week</td><td>See text</td></tr><tr><td>Train an animal for a purpose</td><td>See text</td><td>See text</td></tr></table><p><i>Handle an Animal:</i> This means to command an animal to perform a task or trick it knows. If the animal's condition is something other than normal (it's fatigued or injured, for example), the Difficulty increases by +5. If the check is successful, the animal performs the task or trick on its next action.</p><p><i>"Push" an Animal:</i> Pushing an animal means getting it to perform a task or trick it doesn't know but is physically capable of doing. If the check is successful, the animal performs the task or trick on its next action.</p><p><i>Teach an Animal a Trick:</i> You can teach an animal a specific trick, such as "attack" or "stay," with one week of work and a successful Handle Animal check (Difficulty 15 for simple tricks, 20 or more for complex tricks). An animal with an Intelligence of -5 can learn a maximum of three tricks, while an animal with an Intelligence of -4 can learn a maximum of six tricks.</p><p><i>Train an Animal:</i> Rather than teaching an animal individual tricks, you can train an animal for a general purpose, like combat, guarding, riding, and so forth. This requires a Difficulty 20 skill check. Essentially, an animal's purpose represents a set of tricks fitting a common scheme. An animal can be trained for one purpose only.</p><p><i>Obey Master Only:</i> You can teach an animal to obey only you. Teaching an animal to only obey you counts as a trick (in terms of how many tricks the animal can learn). It does not require a check; however, it increases the Difficulty of all tricks you teach the animal by +5. Any person other than you who attempts to make the animal perform a trick takes a -5 penalty on his Handle Animal check. If the animal already knows any tricks, you must retrain it (with the +5 Difficulty) in order to gain this benefit. If you increase the Difficulty of the tricks you teach animal by 10, you increase the penalty others take on their Handle Animal checks to -10.||Yes.|See above. Teaching and training an animal happens between scenes.|An untrained character uses Charisma checks to handle and push animals, but can't teach or train animals.|
Intimidate|Cha|||Interaction|||You know how to use threats (real or implied) to get others to cooperate with you.|You can convince people to do what you want them to do with a successful Intimidate check. The base difficulty for an Intimidate check is 10 plus the target's level, plus their Wisdom.</p><p class="notation">Base Difficulty = 10 + level + Wisdom</p><p>This difficulty is modified by the risk entailed on the part of the target doing what you are asking them to do.</p><table class="last-row"><th width="10%" class="center">Modifier</th><th width="15%">Risk</th><th>Description</th><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">-10</td><td>None</td><td>No risk, no chance that the target will be punished or suffer because of the desired action.</td></tr><tr><td class="center">-5</td><td>Minor</td><td>Slight risk of being discovered doing something not very serious.</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">+0</td><td>Moderate</td><td>Either slight risk of being discovered doing something moderately serious, or moderate risk of being discovered doing something not very serious.</td></tr><tr><td class="center">+5</td><td>Significant</td><td>Real risk of moderate punishment or suffering.</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">+10</td><td>Major</td><td>Obvious and unavoidable risk of moderate punishment or suffering, or moderate risk of serious trouble.</td></tr><tr><td class="center">+15</td><td>High-Risk</td><td>Obvious and unaviodable risk of serious punishment or suffering.</td></tr></table><p>The difficulty is further modified by the current degree of comfort or security the target feels.<table width="500px"><th class="center">Modifier</th><th>Description</th><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">-5</td><td>Target is alone, or surrounded by enemies.</td></tr><tr><td class="center">+5</td><td>Target is surrounded by allies.</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">-5</td><td>Target is in unfamiliar surroundings</td></tr><tr><td class="center">+5</td><td>Target is in comfortable or supportive surroundings</td></tr></table><p>If your Intimidate check fails by 5 or more, the target may actually do the opposite of what you wanted.</p><p><i><a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Feint">Feint</a>:</i> You can make an Intimidate check to <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Feint">feint in combat</a>.</p><p><i>Provoke:</i> You can use the Intimidate skill to provoke an opponent to attack you. Make an Intimidate check as a full-round action. If successful, the opponent moves toward, charges or attacks you for a number of rounds equal to your ranks in Intimidate, as long as he is not attacked by someone else. You must make a new check each time your opponent is attacked by someone else.|<i>Mass Intimidate:</i> You can attempt to intimidate more than one subject at a time. You suffer a -2 penalty to your check per opponent beyond the first. When calculating the Difficulty of the Intimidate check, use the highest level of the characters in the group, and the highest Wisdom (even if they are not the same characters).</p><p><i>Power Intimidate:</i> In return for a -5 penalty to your Intimidate check, you can increase the penalty you inflict for rendering a foe <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Shaken">shaken</a> with the <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Feint">feint</a> action by -1. You can take this challenge multiple times to increase the penalty.</p><p><i>Bark Commands:</i> If your command can be expressed as brief instruction of only a couple of words, you can use the <a href="BasicsChecks.php#Challenges">Fast Task challenge</a> to reduce your Intimidate check to a free action, even though Intimidate is normally a full-round action. Such a challenge is equal to taking the <a href="BasicsChecks.php#Challenges">Fast Task challenge</a> three times, so the total penalty on your Intimidate check is -15.|No. Even if the initial check succeeds, the other character can only be intimidated so much, and trying again doesn't help. If the initial check fails, the other character has become more firmly resolved to resist, and trying again is futile. You can make Intimidate checks to <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Feint">feint</a> in combat until you fail, after which the target is no longer intimidated by you.|An Intimidate check is a full-round action. <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Feint">Feinting in combat</a> is a standard action.||
Jump|Str||Armor||||You can jump further than usual.|Distance moved by jumping, which is a move action, is counted against your maximum movement in a round. You can start a jump at the end of one turn and complete the jump at the beginning of your next turn.</p><p><i><a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Feint">Feint</a>:</i> You may make a Jump check to <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Feint">feint in combat</a>.</p><p><i>Long Jump:</i> This is a horizontal jump. At the midpoint of the jump, you attain a vertical height equal to one-quarter the horizontal distance. The distance you jump is equal to the result of your Jump check in feet.</p><p><i>High Jump:</i> This is a vertical leap, made to jump up to grasp something overhead, such as a tree limb or ledge. The height you can reach with your hands is equal to half your Jump check, in feet.</p><p><i>Hop Up:</i> You can jump up onto an object of half your height or less with a Difficulty 10 Jump check. Doing so counts as 10 feet of movement.||No.|Jump is a move action.|Characters with greater-than average speed receive a bonus on their Jump checks for long jumps equal to +1 for every 15 ft. of speed they have above 30 ft.|
Knowledge|Int|Yes|||Yes||This skill encompasses several specialties, each of them treated as a separate skill. These specialties are defined below.|Make a Knowledge check to see if you know something. The Difficulty for answering a question is 10 for easy questions, 15 for basic questions, and 20 to 30 for difficult questions. The Narrator sets the difficulty for a particular question.</p><p>Knowledge specialties, and the topics each one encompasses, are as follows:<ul><li><b>Business:</b> How things get done, how money gets made. You can navigate bureaucracy, and understand what's going on with commerce and financial affairs. Identifying the dockmaster is a Difficulty 15, knowing who the dockmaster reports to is a Difficulty 20, and reviewing the dockmaster's records to find out who he REALLY reports to is a Difficulty 25.</li><li><b>History:</b> Events, personalities, and cultures of the past. Archaeology and antiquities. Dusty stuff. Identifying an ancient text written in a familiar script is a Difficulty 10, recalling the fate of a vanished culture that left these huge monuments is a Difficulty 15, and remembering the command word that long-dead king used to open his burial vault is a Difficulty 35</li><li><b>Local:</b> Choose a location that you are familiar with &mdash; an island or a town. The more specific the location, the more specific your knowledge. Finding a good hotel is a Difficulty 10, finding an honest merchant is a Difficulty 20, and finding that sewer grate that leads to the underground raptor pits is a Difficulty 30.</li><li><b>Navigation:</b> How to find your way across the sea (or land), using charts, instruments and landmarks. Familiar terrain (or clear weather) is a Difficulty 10, either unfamiliar terrain or overcast weather is a Difficulty 20, and both unfamiliar terrain and overcast weather is a Difficulty 30.</li><li><b>Science:</b> All that wild and crazy stuff these wacky "mad scientists" do. Mechanical engineering, applied physics, ballistics, hydrodynamics &mdash; it's all "science". Understanding the operation of a cannon is a Difficulty 10, understanding the chemical basis of Imperial rockets is a Difficulty 20, and understanding Doctor Kalchok's raygun is a Difficulty 35.</li><li><b>Sea Lore:</b> Understanding the weather, tides, creatures and other realities of seafaring life. You can predict the weather (Difficulty 10 for tomorrow, increasing by 5 for each day further into the future), and answer questions like "What's that?"</li><li><b>Streetwise:</b> Street and urban culture, local underworld personalities and events. Knowing who to graft and who to just shut up and listen to. Knowing who will sell you some black-market gunpowder is a Difficulty 15, knowing who's running the biggest gunpowder smuggling operation in town is a Difficulty 20, and knowing where the lover of the boss of the biggest gunpowder smuggling operation in town likes to hang out and drink too much is a Difficulty 30.</li><li><b>Supernatural:</b> The supernatural, whatever it may encompass &mdash; from strange spirits to undead monsters to whatever it is that Imperial sorcerer is about to do. Recognizing what brand of magic someone is using (Imperial, Heavenly Medicine, etc) is a Difficulty 15, identifying what kind of spirit is hanging around this creepy place is a Difficulty 20, and realising what specific power is being used before it wallops you is a Difficulty 25.</li></ul><p>||Usually no. The check represents what a character knows; thinking about a topic a second time doesn't let you know something you didn't know before. The Narrator may allow another Knowledge check if a character gets access to a better source of information. For example, a hero who doesn't know the answer to a particular question on his own might get another check with access to a library (and could take 20 on that check, depending on the circumstances).|A Knowledge check can be a reaction, but otherwise requires a full-round action. Taking 20 on a Knowledge check requires at least an hour, longer if the Narrator decides the information you're looking for is particularly obscure or otherwise restricted. In any event, taking 20 on a Knowledge check means the attempt will not complete during the current scene.|An untrained Knowledge check is simply an Intelligence check. Without actual training, a character can only answer easy or basic questions about a topic.</p><p>You can take 10 when making a Knowledge check. You can take 20 only if you have access to the appropriate research materials (such as a library).|
Medicine|Wis|Yes||||Yes|You're trained in understanding the body and treating injuries and illness.|The Difficulty and effect depend on the task attempted.</p><p><i>Diagnosis (Difficulty 10):</i> You can diagnose injuries and ailments with an eye toward providing treatment. At the Narrator's discretion, a successful diagnosis can provide a +2 bonus on Medicine checks for treatment. This takes at least a full-round action, if not longer.</p><p><i>Provide Care (Difficulty 15):</i> Providing care means treating a wounded person for a day or more or providing routine medical care, such as assisting in the delivery of a baby. If successful, the patient adds your Medicine rank to any recovery rolls. You can tend up to your skill rank in patients at one time.</p><p><i>Revive (Difficulty 15):</i> With a medical kit, you can remove the <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Dazed">dazed</a>, <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Stunned">stunned</a>, or <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Unconscious">unconscious</a> condition from a character. This check is a standard action. A successful check removes the condition. You can't revive an <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Unconscious">unconscious</a> character who is <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Dying">dying</a> without stabilizing the character first.</p><p><i>Stabilize (Difficulty 15):</i> With a medical kit, you can tend to a character who is <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Dying">dying</a>. As a standard action, a successful Medicine check stabilizes the <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Dying">dying</a> character.</p><p><i>Treat Disease (Difficulty 15):</i> You can tend to a character infected with a treatable disease. Every time the diseased character makes a saving throw against disease effects (after the initial contamination), you can first make a Medicine check requiring 10 minutes. If your check succeeds, you provide a bonus on the diseased character's saving throw equal to your Medicine rank.</p><p><i>Treat Poison (Difficulty 15):</i> You can tend to a poisoned character. When a poisoned character makes a saving throw against a poison's secondary effect, you first make a Medicine check as a standard action. If the check succeeds, you provide a bonus on the poisoned character's saving throw equal to your Medicine rank.|<i>Heal Thyself:</i> Taking a -5 penalty on your check, you can use the Medicine skill on yourself to diagnose, provide care, or treat disease or poison.|Yes, for reviving <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Dazed">dazed</a>, <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Stunned">stunned</a>, or <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Unconscious">unconscious</a> characters, and stabilizing <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Dying">dying</a> characters. No, for all other uses of the skill.|Medicine checks take different amounts of time based on the task at hand, as described above. Note that the provide care use of Medicine will not complete in the current scene.|You can take 10 when making a Medicine check. You can take 20 only when giving long-term care or attempting to revive <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Dazed">dazed</a>, <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Stunned">stunned</a>, or <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Unconscious">unconscious</a> characters.</p><p>If you do not have the appropriate medical equipment, you take a -4 penalty on your skill check.|
Notice|Wis||||||You use this skill to notice and perceive things.|Make a skill check to notice something. Notice checks generally suffer a penalty of -1 per 10 feet between you and the thing you're trying to notice. If you're distracted, you take a -5 penalty on Notice checks. Making out details &mdash; such as clearly hearing a conversation or reading text &mdash; requires you to beat the Difficulty of the Notice check by 10.</p><p>The Narrator might make Notice checks secretly so you don't know whether there was something to notice. The most common sorts of Notice checks are as follows:</p><p><i>Listening:</i> Make a check against a Difficulty based on how loud the noise is or against an opposed <a href="Skills.php?Name=Stealth">Stealth</a> check.</p><table><th width="25%" class="center">Difficulty</th><th>Sound</th><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">-10</td><td>A battle</td></tr><tr><td class="center">0</td><td>People talking</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">10</td><td>A person walking at a slow pace, trying not to make any noise</td></tr><tr><td class="center">30</td><td>A bird flying through the air</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">+5</td><td>Through a door</td></tr><tr><td class="center">+10</td><td>Listener asleep</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">+15</td><td>Through a solid wall</td></tr></table><p><i>Spotting:</i> Make a check against a Difficulty based on how visible the object is. Spot is often used to notice a person or creature hiding from view. In such cases, your Notice check is opposed by the <a href="Skills.php?Name=Stealth">Stealth</a> check of the character trying not to be seen. Spot is also used to detect someone in disguise (see the Disguise skill) or to notice a concealed weapon on another person.</p><p><i>Other Senses:</i> You can make Notice checks involving smell, taste, and touch, as appropriate. Use the same guidelines as listen and spot checks above. Noticing something obvious is Difficulty 0. Subtle things are around Difficulty 10, hidden things Difficulty 20 or more. Noticing subtle supernatural phenomena requires special powers.|<i>Locate Noise:</i> For a -5 penalty on a Notice (listen) check, you can attempt to pinpoint the source of a sound. A successful check tells you the exact location. The source still gets the benefits of total concealment, but you can attack it even if you can't see it. Among other things, this allows you to attack while blinded or fighting an invisible foe. If your check fails, you become confused as to the location of the source  of the sound.|You can make a Notice check every time you have the opportunity to notice something new. As a move action, you can attempt to notice something you failed (or believe you failed) to notice previously.|A Notice check is either a reaction (if called for by the Narrator) or a move action (if you actively take the time to try to notice something).|When several characters are trying to notice the same thing, the Narrator can make a single d20 roll and use it for all the characters' skill checks.</p><p>You can take 10 or take 20 when making a Notice check. Taking 20 means you spend 1 minute attempting to notice something that may or may not be there. 
Perform|Cha|||Yes|Yes||This skill encompasses several types of performance, each treated as a separate skill.|You are accomplished in some type of artistic expression and know how to put on a performance. The quality of your performance depends on your check result.</p><p>The Perform specialties are as follows:</p><ul><li><i>Acting:</i> You can perform drama, comedy, or action-oriented roles with some level of skill.</li><li><i>Dance:</i> You are a dancer, capable of performing rhythmic and patterned movements to music.</li><li><i>Oratory:</i> You can deliver dramatic and effective speeches and monologues.</li><li><i>Music:</i> You can play instruments, sing and make lovely noises.</li></ul><p>To determine the result of a performance, make a Perform check and consult the following table:</p><table width="75%"><th width="25%" class="center">Check Result</th><th>Performance</th><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">10</td><td>Amateur performance.

As a full-round action, make a Perform check (Difficulty d20 + opponent's total level + opponent's Wisdom score + opponent's modifiers on saves against mind-influencing effects). If successful, the opponent moves toward, charges, or attacks you for a number of rounds equal to your ranks in Perform, as long as he is not attacked by someone else. You must make a new check each time your opponent is attacked by someone else.</p><p><i>Feint:</i> You can use the Perform (dance) skill to <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Feint">feint in combat</a>.|<i>Targeted Provoke:</i> In return for a -5 penalty, you can provoke an opponent to attack a target he is unfriendly with. For an additional -5 penalty, you can force him to attack a target he is indifferent towards. If successful, the opponent moves towards, charges or attacks the target for a number of rounds equal to your ranks in Perform, as long as he is not attacked by someone else. You need to make a new check each time your opponent is attacked by someone else.|Not for the same performance and audience.|A Perform check usually requires at least several minutes to an hour or more. Long performances may best be handled between scenes. Provoking an opponent is a full-round action. Using Perform to <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Feint">feint in combat</a> is a standard action.||
Ride|Dex|Yes|Armor||||Use this skill to ride a mount, like a horse or even a dolphin or a dinosaur.|Routine tasks, such as ordinary movement, don't require a skill check. Make a check only when some unusual circumstance exists (such as inclement weather or an icy surface) or when you are riding in a dramatic situation (being chased or attacked, for example, or trying to reach a destination in a limited amount of time). While riding, you can attempt simple maneuvers or stunts.</p><p>Easy riding maneuvers, like staying in the saddle in a fight or guiding a mount with your knees, have a Difficulty of 5. An average maneuver, like a full gallop or dodging around an obstacle, has a Difficulty of 10. Difficult maneuvers, like using your mount as cover, jumping, or suffering no harm in a fall, have a Difficulty of 15. Challenging maneuvers, like a fast mount or dismount (as a free action) or controlling a panicking mount, have a Difficulty of 20.</p><p><i>Assist Skill Check:</i> If your mount must make a Strength- or Dexterity-based skill check, you can use your Ride skill to aid it. This applies only to skill checks in which a rider could logically aid his mount.</p><p><i>Riding Feint:</i> You can use your Ride skill to <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Feint">feint in combat</a>. Your opponent opposes the attempt with their <a href="Skills.php?Name=Sense%20Motive">Sense Motive</a> or Ride skill, whichever is better.||Most Ride checks have consequences for failure that make trying again impossible.|A Ride check is a move action. Riding Feint is a standard action.|If you lack the appropriate saddle, tack, and harness for your mount, you suffer a -4 penalty on your Ride checks.|
Search|Int||||||You can search an area looking for clues, hidden items, traps, and other such details. The <a href="Skills.php?Name=Notice">Notice</a> skill allows you to notice things immediately, while Search allows you to pick up on details with some effort.|You generally must be within 10 feet of the area to be examined. You can examine up to a 5-foot-by-5-foot area or a volume of goods 5 feet on a side with a single check.</p><p>A Search check can turn up individual footprints, but does not allow you to follow tracks or tell you which direction the creature or creatures went or came from (see the <a href="Skills.php?Name=Survival">Survival skill</a>).</p><table width="400px"><th width="25%" class="center">Difficulty</th><th>Task</th><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">10</td><td>Ransack an area to find a certain object.</td></tr><tr><td class="center">20</td><td>Notice a typical secret compartment, a simple trap, or an obscure clue.</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">25+</td><td>Find a complex or well-hidden secret compartment or trap.

The Narrator can assume that characters with the time take 20 on their check to hide the object.|||A Search check is a full-round action.||
Sense Motive|Wis||||||You can tell someone's true intentions by paying attention to body language, inflection, and intuition.|A successful Sense Motive check allows you to avoid the effects of some interaction skills. You can also use the skill to tell when someone is behaving oddly or assess their trustworthiness.</p><p><i>Evaluate:</i> You can use this skill to make an assessment of a social situation. With a successful check (Difficulty 20), you can get a feeling when something is wrong. You can also tell if someone is trustworthy and honorable (or not) with an opposed Sense Motive and <a href="Skills.php?Name=Bluff">Bluff</a> check.</p><p><i>Combat Evaluate:</i> As a full-round action, you study a single opponent to understand her fighting style, current disposition, and combat plans. This target must be within 30 feet of you. Make a Sense Motive check opposed by your target's <a href="Combat.php#CombatBonus">combat bonus</a>. If you succeed, you gain a +1 to your <a href="Combat.php#CombatBonus">combat bonus</a> (thus improving your <a href="Combat.php#AttackBonus">attack bonus</a>, your <a href="Combat.php#ManeuverBonus">maneuver bonus</a> and your <a href="Combat.php#BaseDefense">Defense</a>) against that target.</p><p>If you fail your check by 5 points or more, you read your foe incorrectly. For the rest of the encounter, you suffer a -1 penalty to your <a href="Combat.php#CombatBonus">combat bonus</a> against her.</p><p><i>Notice Influence:</i> You can make a Sense Motive check to notice someone acting under supernatural influence. The Difficulty is 10 + the power's rank.</p><p><i>Notice Innuendo:</i> You can use Sense Motive to detect a hidden message transmitted via the Bluff skill (Difficulty equal to the <a href="Skills.php?Name=Bluff">Bluff</a> check result). If your check result beats the Difficulty, you understand the secret message. If your check fails by 5 or more, you misinterpret the message in some fashion. If you are not the intended recipient of the message, your Difficulty increases by 5.</p><p><i>Resist Interaction:</i> Make a Sense Motive check to resist or ignore the effects of certain interaction skills, such as <a href="Skills.php?Name=Bluff">Bluff</a> or <a href="Skills.php?Name=Intimidate">Intimidate</a>. If the result of your check exceeds your opponent's check result, you are unaffected.|<i>Read Situation:</i> For every +5 you increase the Difficulty of your Sense Motive check, you learn one fact about the situation at hand when evaluating a situation or individual. The Narrator may tell you things like someone's apparent goal(s), the nature of an interaction, and so forth.</p><p><i>Combat Clarity:</i> In return for a -5 penalty to your skill check, you increase the bonuses provided by the combat evaluate use of Sense Motive by +1. You can increase the penalty to -10 to increase the bonuses by +2. The penalties you suffer for a check that fails by 5 points or more do not increase.|No, though you can make a Sense Motive check for each interaction attempt against you.|A Sense Motive check may be made as a reaction to notice or resist something. (When that's the case, the Narrator may roll the Sense Motive check in secret, so you don't know if there's something to notice or not.) Using Sense Motive to evaluate a person or situation takes at least 1 minute.||
Sleight of Hand|Dex|Yes|Armor||||You can perform feats of legerdemain such as picking pockets, palming small objects (making them seem to disappear), and so forth.|A check against Difficulty 10 lets you palm a coin-sized, unattended object. When you perform this skill under close observation, your skill check is opposed by the observer's <a href="Skills.php?Name=Notice">Notice</a> check. The observer's check doesn't prevent you from performing the action, just from doing it unnoticed. If using Sleight of Hand to do tricks to impress an audience, you can treat it as a <a href="Skills.php?Name=Perform">Perform</a> specialty.</p><p><i><a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Feint">Feint</a>:</i> You may make a Sleight of Hand check to <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Feint">feint in combat</a>.</p><p><i>Thievery:</i> When you try to take something from another person, your opponent makes a <a href="Skills.php?Name=Notice">Notice</a> check to detect the attempt. To obtain the object, you must get a result of 20 or higher, regardless of the opponent's check result. The opponent detects the attempt if his check result beats your character's check result, whether you take the object or not.</p><p><i>Planting:</i> You can make a Sleight of Hand check to plant a small object on a person, slip something into their pocket, drop something into their drink, and so forth. This has the same Difficulty and <a href="Skills.php?Name=Notice">Notice</a> check as thievery.</p><p><i>Concealment:</i> You can use Sleight of Hand to conceal a small weapon or object on your body, making your check result the Difficulty of a <a href="Skills.php?Name=Search">Search</a> check to find the object.</p><p><i>Snatch Object:</i> You can attempt to snatch thrown objects out of the air as a readied action. If an opponent throws a light object at you, you may make a Sleight of Hand check (Difficulty equal to the opponent's attack roll) to snatch the item out of the air. You suffer a -5 penalty to snatch one-handed items (as opposed to light), and a -10 penalty to snatch two-handed items. You suffer an additional -5 penalty if the item was thrown at a target other than yourself (but you may only snatch items that pass adjacent to you). If successful, you snatch the item and may throw it back at the original attacker (even though it isn't your turn) or keep it for later use.||A second Sleight of Hand attempt against the same target, or when being watched by the same observer, has a Difficulty 10 higher than the first check if the first check failed or if the attempt was noticed.|A Sleight of Hand check is a standard action.|You can make an untrained Sleight of Hand check to conceal a weapon or object, but must always take 10 when doing so, so you can't do it while under stress. 
Stealth|Dex||Armor||||You're skilled in moving about unseen and unheard.|Your Stealth check is opposed by the <a href="Skills.php?Name=Notice">Notice</a> check of anyone who might notice you. While using Stealth, you can move up to half your normal speed at no penalty. At more than half and up to your full speed, you take a -5 penalty. It's practically impossible (-20 penalty) to use Stealth while attacking, moving all out, or charging.</p><p><i>Hiding:</i> If others have spotted you, you can't use Stealth to remain unseen. You can run around a corner so you are out of sight and then use Stealth to hide, but others then know at least where you went. Note you can't hide if you have no cover or concealment (since that means you're standing out in the open).</p><p><i>Creating a Diversion to Hide:</i> You can make a <a href="Skills.php?Name=Bluff">Bluff</a> check to gain the momentary diversion needed to attempt a Stealth check while people are aware of you. When the others turn their attention from you, you can make a Stealth check if you can get to a hiding place of some kind. (As a general guideline, the hiding place has to be within 1 foot for every rank you have in Stealth.) This check, however, is at a -5 penalty because you have to move fast.</p><p><i>Tailing:</i> You can use Stealth to tail someone at your normal speed. This assumes you have some cover or concealment (crowds of people, shadows, fog, etc.). If the subject is worried about being followed, he can make a <a href="Skills.php?Name=Notice">Notice</a> check (opposed by your Stealth check) every time he changes course (goes around a street corner, exits a building, and so on). If he is unsuspecting, he only gets a <a href="Skills.php?Name=Notice">Notice</a> check after each hour of being tailed. If the subject notices you, you can make a <a href="Skills.php?Name=Bluff">Bluff</a> check, opposed by <a href="Skills.php?Name=Sense%20Motive">Sense Motive</a>. If you succeed, you manage to pass off your presence as coincidence and can continue tailing. A failed <a href="Skills.php?Name=Bluff">Bluff</a> check, or being noticed a second time, means the subject knows something is up.|<i>Accelerated Stealth:</i> You can move up to your normal speed in exchange for a -5 penalty to your Stealth check. In return for a -20 penalty to your check, you can move faster than your normal speed, such as by running or charging.</p><p><i>Slip Between Cover:</i> You can make a Stealth check at a penalty to quickly cross an area lacking cover or concealment without automatically revealing yourself. For every 5 feet of open space you cross, you take a -5 penalty to your Stealth check. You also take the normal Stealth penalties for moving faster than half your normal speed and such. So, you can slip past a 5-foot open doorway without being seen, for example, or duck from shadow to shadow.</p><p><i>Vanishing:</i> You can "disappear" when no one is watching you. This is essentially a use of Stealth to hide when the character has concealment or a distraction (no one looking directly at him, essentially). It requires a Stealth check with a -5 penalty, and the character must be within a normal move action of an exit, or some cover or concealment (a window, skylight, ventilation duct, etc.). A successful check means the character seems to disappear; an observer turns around only to discover that he is gone. Characters can use <a href="Skills.php?Name=Bluff">Bluff</a> or <a href="Skills.php?Name=Intimidate">Intimidate</a> to gain the momentary distraction needed to vanish in this way.||Stealth is a move action.||
Survival|Wis||||||You use this skill to survive in the wilderness, finding food and shelter and safely guiding others.|You can keep yourself and others safe and fed in the wild.</p><table width="600px"><th width="25%" class="center">Difficulty</th><th>Task</th><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">10</td><td>Get along in the wild.

If you fail, you choose the wrong direction, but realise your mistake either at the next juncture for a decision (if you are finding your way through a maze of streams, for example, or amidst ancient tunnels), or the following day.</p><p><i>Trailblazing:</i> You can use this skill to cut a trail through the toughest terrain and allow you and your allies to increase your overland movement. When you travel over terrain that <a href="PlayingPhysical.php#HamperedMovement">hampers your movement</a>, you may make a Survival check at Difficulty 15. If you succeed, you increase your movement by 1/4. If you fail, you suffer the normal movement penalty. You canno go faster than your normal unhampered speed.</p><p>You can blaze a trail for up to five people (including yourself) without a penalty.</p><p>You cannot use the trailblazing ability in combat.</p><p><i>Track:</i> You can use Survival to find and follow tracks. Finding tracks or following them for one mile requires a successful Survival check. You must make another Survival check each time the tracks become difficult to follow. You move at half your normal speed while tracking (or at your normal speed with a -5 penalty on the check, or at up to twice your normal speed with a -20 penalty on the check). The Difficulty depends on the surface, as given on the Surface table below.</p> <table class="last-row" style="width:300px"><th>Surface</th><th class="center">Difficulty</th> <tr class="odd-row"><td>Very soft ground</td><td class="center">5</td></tr> <tr><td>Soft ground</td><td class="center">10</td></tr> <tr class="odd-row"><td>Firm ground</td><td class="center">15</td></tr> <tr><td>Hard ground</td><td class="center">20</td></tr></table> <p><b>Very Soft Ground:</b> Any surface (fresh snow, thick dust, wet mud) that holds deep, clear impressions of footprints. </p><p><b>Soft Ground:</b> Any surface soft enough to yield to pressure, but firmer than wet mud or fresh snow, in which a creature leaves frequent but shallow footprints. </p><p><b>Firm Ground:</b> Most normal outdoor surfaces (such as lawns, fields, woods, and the like) or exceptionally soft or dirty indoor surfaces (thick rugs and dirty or dusty floors).

Swim|Str||Armor||||You can swim and maneuver underwater.|A successful Swim check allows you to swim one-quarter your speed as a move action or half your speed as a full-round action. If the check fails, you make no progress through the water. If the check fails by 5 or more, you go underwater. If you are underwater, you must hold your breath to avoid drowning. The Difficulty for the Swim check depends on the condition of the water:</p><table width="50%"><th>Water</th><th class="center">Difficulty</th><tr class="odd-row"><td>Calm water</td><td class="center">10</td></tr><tr><td>Rough water</td><td class="center">15</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td>Stormy water</td><td class="center">20</td></tr></table><p>Each hour you swim, make a Swim check (Difficulty 20).

You can take this challenge up to three times to increase your swimming speed up to your normal speed. You suffer the normal effects of failing your Swim check.</p><p><i>Rescuing:</i> Rescuing another character who cannot swim (for whatever reason) increases the Difficulty of your Swim checks by +5, but allows both of you to remain afloat.||A Swim check is either a move action or a full-round action, as described above.|The <a href="EquipmentArmor.php">Armor Penalty</a> for Swim checks is double normal.|
