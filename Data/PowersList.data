Animate Object|Fatiguing||Maintenance|||You can cause objects to come to life, gift them with perception and limited intelligence, making them independent entities under your control. They remain animated for a number of rounds equal to your power ranks after you stop maintaining the power.</p><p>You may only animate as many levels of animated objects as you have power ranks per use of Animate Object. No matter how many times you use this power, you can control only twice your power ranks in animated object levels. If you exceed this, all newly created objects fall under your control, and any excess from previous castings become inert. You choose which objects are released from your spell.</p><p>This power does not, however, give objects any capacity to move beyond what they already possess &mdash; that is, a cart could roll itself in one direction or another, a door could swing back and forth on its hinges, but a bench could not do anything unless it had jointed legs. Such simple animated objects have limited abilities. The level of each simple object is determined by its size:</p><table width="300px"><th>Size</th><th class="center">Level</th><tr class="odd-row"><td>Tiny or Smaller</td><td class="center">1/2</td></tr><tr><td>Small</td><td class="center">2nd</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td>Medium</td><td class="center">4th</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td class="center">7th</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td>Huge</td><td class="center">10th</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td class="center">15th</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td>Colossal</td><td class="center">20th</td></tr></table><p><b>Speed:</b> An object that has jointed limbs or wheels, or a creature that is made of some flexible material, gains the ability to move. The speed of such creatures is determined by comparing their mode of locomotion to their size:</p><table class="last-row" width="600px"><th>Size</th><th class="center">2-3 Legs</th><th class="center">4 or more legs</th><th class="center">Wheels</th><th class="center">Flexible</th><tr class="odd-row"><td>Tiny or smaller</td><td class="center">30 ft.</td><td class="center">40 ft.</td><td class="center">50 ft.</td><td class="center">20 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>Small-Medium</td><td class="center">25 ft.</td><td class="center">30 ft.</td><td class="center">40 ft.</td><td class="center">15 ft.</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td>Large-Huge</td><td class="center">20 ft.</td><td class="center">25 ft.</td><td class="center">30 ft.</td><td class="center">10 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan-Colossal</td><td class="center">15 ft.</td><td class="center">20 ft.</td><td class="center">25 ft.</td><td class="center">5 ft.</td></tr></table><p><b>Abilities:</b> Simple animated objects have no Intelligence or Constitution scores, and have Wisdom and Charisma scores of -5. They gain Strength and Dexterity scores depending on their size:</p><table width="250px"><th>Size</th><th class="center">Str</th><th class="center">Dex</th><tr class="odd-row"><td>Tiny or smaller</td><td class="center">-2</td><td class="center">+2</td></tr><tr><td>Small</td><td class="center">-1</td><td class="center">+1</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td>Medium</td><td class="center">0</td><td class="center">0</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td class="center">+2</td><td class="center">-1</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td>Huge</td><td class="center">+4</td><td class="center">-2</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td class="center">+6</td><td class="center">-3</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td>Colossal</td><td class="center">+8</td><td class="center">-4</td></tr></table><p><b>Skills and Feats:</b> Simple animated objects gain no skills and no feats.</p><p><b>Traits:</b> Depending on their form, simple animated objects may gain one or more of the following traits:</p><p><i>Alternate Forms of Movement:</i> Objects might have additional modes of movement. A wooden object can float and may be able to propel itself, giving it a swim speed. A rope or similar sinuous object has a climb speed equal to half its land speed. A sheet-like object can fly (clumsy maneuverability) at half its normal speed.</p><p><i>Blind:</i> A sheet-like object such as a carpet or tapestry can grapply an opponent up to three sizes larger than itself. The object makes a normal <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Grapple">grapple check</a>. If successful, it wraps itself around the opponent's head, causing that creature to be blinded until removed.</p><p><i>Constrict:</i> A flexible animated object such as a rope, vine or rug deals damage equal to its unarmed damage value plus its Strength score (if positive) with a successsful <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Grapple">grapple check</a> against a creature up to one size larger than itself.</p><p>A creature of at least Large size can make constriction attacks against multiple creatures at once, if they all are at least two sizes smaller than the object and can ft under it.</p><p><i>Trample:</i> An animated object of at least Large size and with a hardness of at least 10 can trample creatures two or more sizes smaller than itself, dealing damage equal to the object's unarmed damagae plus 1-1/2 times it Strength score if positive). Opponents can attempt Reflex saves (Difficulty 10 + 1/2 object's level + object's Str) to halve the damage.</p><p><b>Combat:</b> Simple animated objects gain no combat bonus. They deal damage depending on their size:</p><table width="300px"><th>Size</th><th class="center">Unarmed Damage</th><tr class="odd-row"><td>Tiny or smaller</td><td class="center">+0</td></tr><tr><td>Small</td><td class="center">+1</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td>Medium</td><td class="center">+2</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td class="center">+3</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td>Huge</td><td class="center">+4</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td class="center">+6</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td>Colossal</td><td class="center">+8</td></tr></table><p><b>Saving Throws:</b> Simple animated objects have good Fortitude saves, poor Reflex saves and poor Will saves (of course, having no Constitution, they automatically fail all Fortitude saves anyway). They have a Toughness save based on the material they are made out of adjusted for their size.</p><p><h5>Sophisticated Animated Objects</h5><p>Creating sophisticated objects capable of moving quickly or attacking effectively requires a Craft (mechanics) check. Such objects are considered <a href="CreaturesTemplates.php?Name=Clockwork%20Creature">clockwork creatures</a> and you must create or find them in order to use them. For the purposes of a Craft check, clockwork creatures are Complex objects, requiring a Difficulty 25 Craft check, but in addition, the creature's level is added to the Difficulty, so the Difficulty is 25 + creature level.||Full-Round|
Beast Link|Fatiguing|Concentration||||You can forge a mental connection with an animal, allowing you to perceive what it perceives, using its senses. Make a power check with a Difficulty of 10, modified by <a href="PowersUsing.php#Familiarity">familiarity</a>. If successful, you have mental contact with the animal, meaning you can perceive with the animal's senses and communicate with it mentally. The animal is not under your command, nor can you speak with it as though it were sentient, but you may be able to convince it, using <a href="Skills.php?Name=Handle%20Animal">Handle Animal</a> or various supernatural powers, to do things for you. The link remains until either you dispel it or the current scene ends.<p><b>Mental Grapple:</b> With the Beast Link power you can attempt to <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Mental%20Grapple">mentally grapple</a> an animal. You can attempt to freeze them in place or even drive them unconscious with your Beast Link power.</p><p><b>Deathcry:</b> If a creature you are in mental contact with dies, you must make a Will saving throw or <a href="Powers.php?Name=Psychic%20Shield">Psychic Shield</a> check (Difficulty 20) to avoid being dazed for 1 round by the psychic feedback and trauma.||Move|
Bind Spirit|Fatiguing|||||You can attempt to bind a spirit you have summoned (see <a href="Powers.php?Name=Summon%20Spirit">Summon Spirit</a>) into a fetish you have prepared. You make a power check at a Difficulty equal to 15 + the spirit's level. If successful, the spirit must make a Will saving throw against your Save Difficulty to avoid being bound into the fetish. If the spirit succeeds on its Will save, it may attack you or flee, and it remains in the world for a number days equal to your power ranks. If the spirit fails its save, it becomes bound to the fetish.</p><p>As long as the fetish remains undamaged, the holder may call forth the spirit, command it, and dismiss it. No Diplomacy or Intimidate check is required; the spirit automatically obeys commands from whoever called it forth. When dismissed, the spirit disappears completely until called forth again. If the fetish suffers damage sufficient to render it "disabled" the spirit is freed and may choose its own actions (usually revenge on whoever trapped it) for a number of days equal to the power ranks of the character who first bound it.</p><p><b>Superior Fetish:</b> A well-made fetish increases the Difficulty of the Will save the spirit must make. The quality of the fetish is determined by the <a href="Skills.php?Name=Craft">Craft</a> check of the maker. A <a href="Skills.php?Name=Craft">Craft</a> result of at least 15 is required to make the most basic fetish suitable for binding a spirit. For every 5 points the <a href="Skills.php?Name=Craft">Craft</a> check exceeds 15, the Difficulty of the Will save increases by one.||Full-Round|
Body Control|||Maintenance|||You have great mental control over your body. You can make a Body Control check for a number of different tasks summarized on the following table.</p><table class="last-row" width="600px"><th>Task</th><th class="center">Difficulty</th><tr class="odd-row"><td>Sleep normally despite distractions</td><td class="center">5</td></tr><tr><td>Sleep normally despite difficult distractions</td><td class="center">10 </td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td>Slow breathing to half normal rate</td><td class="center">10 </td></tr><tr><td>Ignore pain or injury</td><td class="center">15</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td>Body awareness</td><td class="center">15</td></tr><tr><td>Resist fear</td><td class="center">15</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td>Speed recovery</td><td class="center">15</td></tr><tr><td>Slow breathing to one-quarter normal rate</td><td class="center">15</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td>Willpower</td><td class="center">15</td></tr><tr><td>Feign death</td><td class="center">20</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td>Overcome disease</td><td class="center">Disease's Save Difficulty</td></tr><tr><td>Overcome poison</td><td class="center">Poison's Save Difficulty</td></tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Sleeping:</b> A successful Body Control check allows you to sleep in difficult conditions, including bad weather, noise, buzzing insects, and so forth.</p><p><b>Slow Breathing:</b> You can deliberately slow your rate of breathing so that you consume less air, vital in situations where there is a limited amount of breathable air available.</p><p><b>Ignore Pain or Injury:</b> You can ignore the effects of pain or injury while awake or asleep. If you choose, nothing can wake you, as long as you make a successful Body Control check.</p><p><b>Body Awareness:</b> You can become very aware of your body while asleep or concentrating. This allows you to sense if you are touched or moved in any way while using <a href="Powers.php?Name=Scrying">Scrying</a>, for example. If you are damaged, subtract the attack's damage bonus from the Difficulty of the Body Control check.</p><p><b>Resist Fear:</b> You can override your body's natural response to fear. With a successful Body Control check, you gain a new saving throw against any fear effect, with a +4 bonus.</p><p><b>Speed Recovery:</b> You can speed your natural healing process, gaining a <a href="CombatDamage.php#Recovery">recovery check</a> in half the normal time, so long as you spend that time in a deep, healing trance.</p><p><b>Willpower:</b> With a Difficulty 15 Body Control check, you can continue to act while <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Disabled">disabled</a> without your condition worsening to <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Dying">dying</a>. You still suffer additional damage normally. You can still spend multiple <a href="BasicsConviction.php">Conviction points</a> in a round while <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Disabled">disabled</a>.</p><p><b>Feign Death:</b> By exerting supreme control over your body, you can enter a deep trance almost indistinguishable from death. A <a href="Skills.php?Name=Notice">Notice</a> check with a Difficulty equal to your Body Control check is required to determine whether you are still alive. Effects that detect life still work on you. While in this state, you also suspend the effects of any disease or poison in your system for as long as you remain in the trance.</p><p><b>Overcome Disease or Poison:</b> By concentrating for a full round, you can substitute your Body Control check for your Fortitude saving throw against a disease or poison in your system. This usually means you can only use Body Control against the secondary effects of a disease or poison, unless it is slow acting and you are warned soon enough to use Body Control to resist the initial effects (in the Narrator's judgment).||Full-Round |
Cloud Minds|Fatiguing|Maintenance||||You make yourself completely undetectable another creature (no matter what sense they are using), by erasing all awareness of your presence from their minds. This power has the following effects.</p><p>First, you are invisible and inaudible to any subjects failing a Will save against your Cloud Minds power. They cannot detect your presence by any means, including the use of supernatural powers.</p><p>Second, the subjects remain unaware of your actions, provided you do not make any attacks or cause any obvious or directly threatening changes in the subjects' environment. If you attack a subject, the effect ends for that subject. If you take an action creating a sustained and obvious change in the subject's environment &mdash; for example, attacking a creature aside from the subject or moving a large or attended object the subject can see &mdash; the subject immediately gains a new saving throw. An ally of the subject able to see or perceive you can use a move action to warn the subject, granting an immediate new saving throw.||Standard|
Cold Shaping|Fatiguing||Maintenance|||You can freeze things with the power of your mind. With a Difficulty 15 Cold Shaping check, you can lower the temperature of an area about a foot across, enough to deal cold damage. A targeted creature makes a Fortitude save against your power, with a failed save resulting in a level of fatigue, just like <a href="PlayingHazards.php#Cold">exposure to a cold environment</a>. Protective clothing has no effect.</p><p>You can freeze roughly a gallon of water into solid ice in a round. For every 2 points your check exceeds the Difficulty, you affect an additional cubic foot (or gallon of liquid).</p><p>You can also decrease the size and damage potential of a fire by 1 point and 1 square foot for every 2 points your Cold Shaping check exceeds Difficulty 10. A fire reduced to a size or damage potential of 0 or less goes out.  This requires a Cold Shaping check with Difficulty 12 for a normal square foot flame. Otherwise, the reduction in the fire requires maintenance.||Standard|
Combat Sense|Fatiguing|||||You can improve your ability in combat by sensing the flow of events around you. A Combat Sense check grants you a bonus to either your <a href="Combat.php#BaseDefense">base defense</a>, your <a href="Combat.php#AttackBonus">attack bonus</a>, or your <a href="Combat.php#ManeuverBonus">maneuver bonus</a> (see the accompanying table). Each round you can split the bonus between your <a href="Combat.php#BaseDefense">base defense</a>, your <a href="Combat.php#AttackBonus">attack bonus</a>, or your <a href="Combat.php#ManeuverBonus">maneuver bonus</a> as you see fit.</p><table width="300px"><th class="center">Result</th><th class="center">Combat Bonus</th><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">Up to 4</td><td class="center">+1</td></tr><tr><td class="center">5-14</td><td class="center">+2</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">15-24</td><td class="center">+3 </td></tr><tr><td class="center">25-34</td><td class="center">+4</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">35+</td><td class="center">+5</td></tr></table><p>Combat Sense lasts for one round per rank.||Move|
Cure|Fatiguing|||||You can heal injuries by touch. With a full-round action, you can grant a subject an immediate <a href="CombatDamage.php#Recovery">recovery check</a> using your Cure check result in place of their Constitution check. If the <a href="CombatDamage.php#Recovery">recovery check</a> fails, you must wait the normal recovery time for that condition or take a <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Bruised">Bruised</a> condition before trying again. You can stabilize a <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Dying">dying</a> character with a Difficulty 10 Cure check.</p><p>You can use Cure on yourself. You can't cure your own <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Staggered">staggered</a> or <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Unconscious">unconscious</a> conditions or stabilize yourself while dying, since you have to be conscious and able to take a full-round action to use Cure. You can use Cure on your own <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Disabled">disabled</a> conditions, but doing so is a strenuous action. If your <a href="CombatDamage.php#Recovery">recovery check</a> is successful, you suffer no ill effects. If it is not, however, your condition worsens to <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Dying">dying</a>.|See above. Otherwise you can retry freely.|Full-Round|
Dominate|Fatiguing||Concentration|Mental Contact||You can mentally control another creature's actions. The target makes a Will saving throw. If the save fails, you control the target's actions while you concentrate and maintain mental contact. You can force the subject to perform any action you wish, within the limits of his abilities. You're generally aware of what the subject experiences via your mental link, but you do not receive direct sensory impressions from him. Subjects forced to take actions against their natures receive a new saving throw with a bonus of +1 to +4, depending on the nature of action. A successful save breaks your control.</p><p><i>Puppet:</i> By taking a -5 penalty on your save Difficulty, you can direct your victim's actions more precisely. You can compel your victim can take physical actions using your skill ranks or your combat bonus, along with any bonuses you have from feats. Your victim does not gain any of your basic abilities, nor can they use any of your supernatural powers. You must be able to see your victim in order to direct their actions in this manner. Anyone observing both you and the victim can make a <a href="Skills.php?Name=Sense%20Motive">Sense Motive</a> check (opposed by your <a href="Skills.php?Name=Bluff">Bluff</a> check, if you are attempting to conceal your powers) to realise that you are directing the victim's actions.||Dominate is a full-round action.|
Drain Vitality||||||You can drain someone's vital energy by touch. The target makes a Will save. If they fail their save, they take a <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Bruised">Bruised</a> condition, while you make a successful Recovery check (thus removing your worst level of damage). You cannot drain targets further once they are <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Unconscious">unconscious</a>.||Drain Vitality is a standard action. |
Earth Shaping|Fatiguing|||||You can shape and move earth and stone. An Earth Shaping check can have one of the following effects:</p><p><b>Move Earth (Difficulty 10):</b> You move dirt (soil, clay, loam, sand), possibly collapsing embankments, moving hillocks, shifting sand dunes, and so forth. However, in no event can rock formations be collapsed or moved. The area to be affected determines the time required and the Difficulty. A 150-foot by 150-foot square (up to 10 feet deep), takes 10 minutes and is Difficulty 10. Each additional such square adds 10 minutes and +5 Difficulty.</p><p>Earth Shaping does not violently break the surface of the ground. Instead, it creates wavelike crests and troughs, with the earth reacting with glacier-like fluidity until the desired result is achieved. Trees, structures, rock formations, and such are mostly unaffected except for changes in elevation and topography. This effect cannot be used for tunneling and is too slow to trap or bury creatures unless they are helpless the entire time the earth is moved.</p><p><b>Soften Earth (Difficulty 10):</b> All natural, undressed earth or stone softens. Wet earth becomes thick mud, dry earth becomes loose sand or dirt, and stone becomes soft clay that is easily molded. You affect a 10-foot square area to a depth of 1 to 4 feet, depending on the Toughness or resilience of the ground at that spot. Each +5 increase in Difficulty affects another 10-foot square. Dressed or worked stone cannot be affected. Earth and stone creatures are not affected either.</p><p>A creature in mud must succeed on a Reflex save against your power or be caught helpless for one round. A creature that succeeds on its save can move through the mud at half speed. Loose dirt is not as troublesome, but all creatures in the area move at only half their normal speed and can't run or charge. Stone softened into clay does not hinder movement, but does allow characters to cut, shape, or excavate areas they may not have been able to affect before.</p><p>While this power does not affect dressed or worked stone, cavern ceilings or vertical surfaces such as cliff faces can be affected. Usually, this causes a moderate collapse or landslide as the loosened material peels away from the face of the wall or roof and falls.</p><p>A moderate amount of damage can be dealt to a structure by softening the ground beneath it, causing it to settle. However, most sturdy structures are only damaged by this, and not destroyed.</p><p><b>Stonecrafting (Difficulty 10):</b> You can mold stone into any shape you wish. You can affect 10 cubic feet of stone. Each additional cubic foot increases the Difficulty by 1 (so at Difficulty 30 you can affect 30 cubic feet). The Narrator may require a <a href="Skills.php?Name=Craft">Craft (sculpting or stonecutting)</a> check to achieve precise results. You perform <a href="Skills.php?Name=Craft">Craft</a> checks involving stone in minutes instead of the hours of normal <a href="Skills.php?Name=Craft">Craft</a> projects. A complex project, which normally takes 24 hours, would therefore take 24 minutes.</p><p><b>Earthquake (Difficulty 30):</b> An intense but highly localized tremor rips the ground. The shock knocks creatures down, collapses structures, opens cracks in the ground, and more. The effect lasts for 1 round, during which time creatures on the ground can't move or attack. An adept must make a <a href="Skills.php?Name=Concentration">Concentration</a> check (Difficulty 20) to use any powers that round. The earthquake affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in an area with a radius of adept level times 10 feet. The specific effects depend on the nature of the terrain.</p><ul><li><i>Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel:</i> The roof collapses, inflicting +16 damage to any creature caught under the cave-in (Difficulty 15 Reflex save for half damage) and pinning them beneath the rubble.</li><li><i>Cliffs:</i> Cliffs crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it fell vertically. Any creature in its path suffers +16 damage (Difficulty 15 Reflex save for half damage) and is pinned beneath the rubble.</li><li><i>Open Ground:</i> Each creature standing in the area must make a Difficulty 15 Reflex save or fall down. Fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25 percent chance to fall into one (Difficulty 20 Reflex save to avoid a fissure). On the round after the quake, all fissures grind shut, crushing and killing any creatures trapped within them.</li><li><i>Structure:</i> Any wooden or masonry structure standing on open ground is destroyed. Heavier stone buildings are damaged. Anyone caught inside a collapsing structure takes +16 damage (Difficulty 15 Reflex save for half damage) and is pinned beneath the rubble.</li><li><i>River, Lake, or Marsh:</i> Fissures open underneath the water, draining it away from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures. Anyone in the area must make a Difficulty 15 Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand. At the end of the round, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud.</li><li><i>Pinned beneath Rubble:</i> Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes +2 non-lethal damage per minute. Unconscious characters make a Difficulty 15 Constitution check each minute to avoid +2 lethal damage.</li></ul>||Move Earth takes from 10 minutes or more, depending on the size of the area. Stonecrafting depends on the project in question. Soften Earth and Earthquake are standard actions. |
Elemental Aura|Fatiguing||||<a href="Powers.php?Name=Cold%20Shaping">Cold</a>, <a href="Powers.php?Name=Energy%20Shaping">Energy</a>, <a href="Powers.php?Name=Fire%20Shaping">Fire</a>, <a href="Powers.php?Name=Water%20Shaping">Water</a>, or <a href="Powers.php?Name=Wind%20Shaping">Wind Shaping</a>|As a standard action, you can surround your body with a damaging elemental aura, causing no harm to you or anything you are wearing or carrying. Anyone touching you while your elemental aura is active suffers +2 damage, with the type of damage determined by the element: cold (<a href="Powers.php?Name=Cold%20Shaping">Cold Shaping</a>), fire (<a href="Powers.php?Name=Fire%20Shaping">Fire Shaping</a>), acid (<a href="Powers.php?Name=Water%20Shaping">Water Shaping</a>), or electricity (<a href="Powers.php?Name=Energy%20Shaping">Energy</a> or <a href="Powers.php?Name=Wind%20Shaping">Wind Shaping</a>). Adepts trained in more than one Shaping power may choose the type of aura when activating it.</p><p>Elemental Aura lasts for a number of rounds equal to your power ranks.|
Elemental Blast|Fatiguing||||<a href="Powers.php?Name=Cold%20Shaping">Cold</a>, <a href="Powers.php?Name=Earth%20Shaping">Earth</a>, <a href="Powers.php?Name=Energy%20Shaping">Energy</a>, <a href="Powers.php?Name=Fire%20Shaping">Fire</a>, <a href="Powers.php?Name=Water%20Shaping">Water</a>, or <a href="Powers.php?Name=Wind%20Shaping">Wind Shaping</a>|You can strike a foe with a focused blast of elemental force. Your Elemental Blast is a normal ranged attack with a range increment of power ranks x 5 feet and a maximum range of ten increments (power ranks x 50 feet).</p><p>An Elemental Blast has a Toughness save Difficulty of 10 + power ranks. <a href="Powers.php?Name=Water%20Shaping">Water</a> and <a href="Powers.php?Name=Wind%20Shaping">Wind Shaping</a> strikes inflict non-lethal damage. If you have <a href="Powers.php?Name=Weather%20Shaping">Weather Shaping</a>, you can call lightning from storm clouds as an Elemental Blast. If you apply the <a href="Feats.php?Name=Widen%20Power">Widen Power feat</a> to an Elemental Blast, it affects all targets within a radius of power ranks x 2 feet from the target point. Targets of a Widened Elemental Blast can make a Reflex saving throw. If successful, the blast only inflicts half damage on that target.||Standard action.|
Elemental Resistance|||||<a href="Powers.php?Name=Cold%20Shaping">Cold</a>, <a href="Powers.php?Name=Earth%20Shaping">Earth</a>, <a href="Powers.php?Name=Energy%20Shaping">Energy</a>, <a href="Powers.php?Name=Fire%20Shaping">Fire</a>, <a href="Powers.php?Name=Water%20Shaping">Water</a>, or <a href="Powers.php?Name=Wind%20Shaping">Wind Shaping</a>|You can resist the effects of an element you're able to shape. Choose a Shaping power you possess. You have a bonus on all saving throws against harm from its element equal to your Power ranks -3, and suffer only non-lethal damage from the element so long as you are conscious and capable of exerting the minimum will required to resist the element's effects. <a href="Powers.php?Name=Water%20Shaping">Water Shaping</a> also grants Acid Resistance, and <a href="Powers.php?Name=Wind%20Shaping">Wind Shaping</a> also grants Electrical Resistance.</p><p>You may acquire this power multiple times. Each time, it affects a different element.|
Elemental Weapon|Fatiguing||||<a href="Powers.php?Name=Cold%20Shaping">Cold</a>, <a href="Powers.php?Name=Energy%20Shaping">Energy</a>, <a href="Powers.php?Name=Fire%20Shaping">Fire</a>, <a href="Powers.php?Name=Water%20Shaping">Water</a>, or <a href="Powers.php?Name=Wind%20Shaping">Wind Shaping</a>|As a standard action, you can imbue a melee weapon you wield with damaging elemental energy, without harming either the weapon or yourself. The weapon does +1 damage/5 ranks, in addition to its normal damage, with the type of damage determined by the element: cold (<a href="Powers.php?Name=Cold%20Shaping">Cold Shaping</a>), fire (<a href="Powers.php?Name=Fire%20Shaping">Fire Shaping</a>), acid (<a href="Powers.php?Name=Water%20Shaping">Water Shaping</a>), or electricity (<a href="Powers.php?Name=Energy%20Shaping">Energy</a> or <a href="Powers.php?Name=Wind%20Shaping">Wind Shaping</a>). Adepts trained in more than one Shaping power may choose the type of energy when activating this power.</p><p><i>Parry Blast:</i> If you have the feat <a href="Feats.php?Name=Deflect%20Arrows">Deflect Arrows</a>, you can use your Elemental Weapon to parry <a href="Powers.php?Name=Elemental%20Blast">Elemental Blasts</a> of the same energy type. Anyone using such a power against you must exceed your <a href="Combat.php#Parry">Parry</a> value in order to strike you.</p><p>Elemental Weapon lasts for a number of rounds equal to your power ranks.|
Energy Shaping|Fatiguing|||||You can shape and direct the flow of electromagnetic energy. You can direct electricity, drain power sources, and focus magnetism to affect metallic objects.</p><p><b>Direct Electricity:</b> You can direct electricity from a free-flowing power source in your line of sight, including mad science contraptions, giant electric eels or even storm clouds. The target makes a Reflex saving throw to avoid being struck. If the save fails, the target takes +2 damage, +1 point for every 5 points your power check exceeds Difficulty 15. So a check result of 32 inflicts +5 damage, for example.</p><p><b>Drain Power:</b> You can drain a power source of its energy. Unattended power sources are automatically drained, while creatures receive a Will saving throw for power sources in their possession. The power check and fatigue Difficulties are based on the size of the power source: 14 for something like a raygun or other hand-held device, 18 for a substantial mad scientist contraptions, and 22 for a any sort of room-sized generator or other crazy electrical thingamabob. Power-drained contraptions might just shut down, but more often begin to overheat and throw off sparks and whatnot prior to exploding. It's just the way these things work. You can also direct drained power as above, using drain power to fuel an electrical attack the following round.</p><p><b>Magnetism:</b> You can manipulate magnetic fields, allowing you to move metallic objects as if you were using the <a href="Powers.php?Name=Move%20Object">Move Object</a> power, with the same Difficulty and fatigue, based on the object's mass. You can also cause a number of (probably sharp and pointy) metallic objects to hurtle through the air, exactly like the "Volley of Arrows" use of the <a href="Feats.php?Name=Wind%20Finesse">Wind Finesse</a> feat. Like a Volley of Arrows, creating a Volley of Sharp Pointy Metallic Objects is a Difficulty 30, and targets all creatures within an area of twenty square feet per rank.</p><p><b>Special:</b> You can take 10 on Energy Shaping checks, but you can't take 20.||Directing electricity and magnetism are standard actions. Draining power is a full-round action. |
Enhance Ability|Fatiguing|||||You can improve your Strength or Dexterity for a single scene. A successful Enhance Ability check adds a bonus to either your Strength or Dexterity score for the rest of the current scene. The result of the check indicates the amount of the bonus. If desired, you can split a bonus of 2 or greater between Strength and Dexterity.<table width="200px"><th>Difficulty</th><th class="center">Bonus</th><tr class="odd-row"><td>15</td><td class="center">+1</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td class="center">+2</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td>25</td><td class="center">+3</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td class="center">+4</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td>35</td><td class="center">+5</td></tr></table||Enhance Ability is a standard action. You can take 20 on this check but it takes two minutes and automatically inflicts a <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Fatigued">Fatigued</a> condition. |
Enhance Other|Fatiguing|||||This works like <a href="Powers.php?Name=Enhance%20Ability">Enhance Ability</a>, except you can enhance others' abilities by touch, and cannot enhance your own abilities with it.</p><p><b>Special:</b> The subject of this power must also make a Fortitude saving throw against fatigue (same Difficulty as the caster) when its duration runs out, to represent the strain placed on the subject's body.|||
Enhance Senses||||||You can enhance your normal sensory abilities. An Enhance Senses check adds a bonus to your <a href="Skills.php?Name=Notice">Notice</a>, <a href="Skills.php?Name=Search">Search</a>, and <a href="Skills.php?Name=Sense%20Motive">Sense Motive</a> checks until the end of the current scene.

Fire Shaping|Fatiguing|||||You can mentally start and control fires. You can make a Fire Shaping check to ignite a fire, to increase the size of an existing fire, or to create light but not heat.</p><p><b>Ignite Fire:</b> You can set any flammable object in your line of sight on fire as a standard action with a successful Fire Shaping check (Difficulty 15). Targets must make a Reflex saving throw (Difficulty 15) to avoid taking +2 fire damage. The target must save each round. A successful save means the fire goes out. You can reignite it with another standard action and successful Fire Shaping check. A character on fire can automatically extinguish the flames by dousing in water (or other flame-retardant material). Spending a full round rolling on the ground grants a +4 bonus on the Reflex saving throw. In addition to using it as an attack, you can use this power to light candles (up to a dozen candles in a 5-foot square with a single skill check), torches, hearth fires, and so forth. At the Narrator's discretion, lighting small fires, like candles, is not fatiguing.</p><p><b>Increase Fire:</b> You can increase the size and intensity of a fire. The Difficulty of the Fire Shaping check is 10 + 1 per square foot of increase. Every two square feet increase the fire's damage potential by +1. The fire maintains its increased size and damage as long as you concentrate, and it can even burn in the absence of fuel; smothering, however, still puts it out. While you maintain an increased flame, a victim does not get a Reflex saving throw to put the fire out (although it can still be extinguished by dousing with water), and the fire does additional damage based on your Fire Shaping check. So, an adept who makes a Difficulty 16 Fire Shaping check can spread a fire over an additional 6 square feet and it does +3 damage.</p><p><b>Light:</b> You can create a glowing spot of supernatural fire that sheds light but no heat, illuminating a 20-foot radius. This requires a move action and a Difficulty 5 Fire Shaping check. You can increase the radius of the illumination by increasing the Difficulty of the check; each +5 Difficulty increases the radius of the illumination by 10 feet. The point of light moves where you direct it within your line of sight, as a move action. Creating light is not fatiguing.||Igniting fires and increasing flames are standard actions. Creating or moving light is a move action. |
Flesh Shaping|Fatiguing|||||You can shape and mold flesh as if it were clay in your hands. The subject must be either willing or helpless for the entire duration of your work (and you can use Flesh Shaping on yourself). You make Flesh Shaping checks to alter a subject's physical features. You cannot change body mass or size, other than a few feet more or less in height by resizing the subject's bones. You can sculpt physical features largely at will. The Difficulty and time required for Flesh Shaping is shown in the table.</p><table width="100%"><th>Difficulty</th><th>Time</th><th>Task</th><tr class="odd-row"><td>15</td><td>1 min.</td><td>Alter facial features or other minor cosmetic features.</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>Rest of current scene</td><td>Alter extensive cosmetic features or overall shape.</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td>30</td><td>Between scenes only</td><td>Extensive alterations to shape, duplicating exact appearance.</td></tr></table><p>Treat your Flesh Shaping check result like a <a href="Skills.php?Name=Disguise">Disguise</a> check for purposes of determining if someone notices the change. Among other things, Flesh Shaping can provide alterations in eye, hair, and skin color, even creating tattoo-like patterns of pigmentation in the skin. It can greatly enhance or diminish physical appearance and attractiveness as well. Any alterations made with Flesh Shaping are permanent, unless reversed through this power or the <a href="Powers.php?Name=Cure">Cure</a> power, either of which must exceed the original check result.||See table.|
Ghost Touch|Fatiguing|||||You can use your power to combat usually untouchable beings. As a standard action, you can focus supernatural power to imbue yourself, or a weapon you wield, with the power to touch and affect <a href="CreaturesSubTypes.php?Name=Incorporeal">incorporeal</a> creatures as if they were solid.</p><p>Ghost Touch lasts for a number of rounds equal to your power ranks.|||
Harm|Fatiguing|||||You can inflict injury with a mere touch, disrupting the body's natural enegry and balance. You must touch the target as a standard action. Success means the target must make a Fortitude saving throw against your power save Difficulty, with failure per the <a href="CombatDamage.php">Damage Track</a> for lethal damage. So a failed save results in a <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Hurt">hurt condition</a>, failure by 5 or more means the target is <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Wounded">wounded</a>, and so forth. Because Harm requires a Fortitude save, armor and other bonuses to Toughness have no effect against it.||Harm is a standard action.|
Heart Reading||||||You can sense and read the emotions of others. A successful Heart Reading check allows you to determine the subject's emotional state. The target gets a Will save to resist. Use of this power is not immediately obvious. Whether you succeed or fail, the subject does not know you are reading his emotions.</p><p>If the target's save fails, you get a general idea of his emotions and mood (not precise thoughts). This grants you a bonus on the next interaction skill check you make against the subject this scene. The bonus is based on your Heart Reading check result.<table width="250px"><th>Result</th><th class="center">Interaction Bonus</th><tr class="odd-row"><td>Up to 4</td><td class="center">+1</td></tr><tr><td>5-14</td><td class="center">+2</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td>15-24</td><td class="center">+3</td></tr><tr><td>25-34</td><td class="center">+4</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td>35+</td><td class="center">+5</td></tr></table>|You can only use Heart Reading on a subject once during the same scene.|Heart Reading is a free action. The bonus until you make an interaction skill check against the target in this scene. |
Heart Shaping|Fatiguing||Concentration|||With this power, you can impose emotions on others. The target makes a Will saving throw. If the save fails, you can impose any one of the following emotional states on them:</p><p><b>Calm:</b> The target is drained of any intense emotions. The subject is calm and incapable of taking violent action (although it can defend itself) or doing anything else destructive. Any aggressive action or damage against the subject breaks the effect. This power dispels any other <a href="Powers.php?Name=Heart%20Shaping">Heart Shaping</a> effect, and immediately ends a use of the <a href="Feats.php?Name=Rage">Rage</a> feat.</p><p><b>Despair:</b> As a weight of ngative emotion floods them, the target suffers a -2 penalty on saving throws, attack rolls, checks, and damage. Despair dispels the effects of hope.</p><p><b>Fear:</b> The target flees from the object of its fear (chosen by you). Fear dispels the effects of rage. It also immediately ends a use of the <a href="Feats.php?Name=Rage">Rage feat</a>.</p><p><b>Friendship:</b> The target's attitude shifts to the next more positive attitude (hostile to unfriendly, unfriendly to indifferent, and so forth). See <a href="PlayingSocial.php">Social Actions</a>. Creatures involved in combat continue to fight back normally, however. Friendship dispels the effects of hatred.</p><p><b>Hatred:</b> The target's attitude shifts to the next more negative attitude (indifferent to unfriendly, unfriendly to hostile, and so forth). See <a href="PlayingSocial.php">Social Actions</a>. Hatred dispels the effects of friendship.</p><p><b>Hope:</b> The target gains a +2 bonus on saving throws, attack rolls, checks, and damage. Hope dispels the effects of despair.</p><p><b>Rage:</b> The target gains the effects of the <a href="Feats.php?Name=Rage">Rage feat</a> from Chapter 3. They are compelled to fight, heedless of danger. Rage does not stack with the <a href="Feats.php?Name=Rage">Rage feat</a> or with itself. Rage dispels the effects of fear.</p><p>All these effects last until the end of the current scene.||Heart Shaping is a standard action.|
Illusion|Fatiguing||Concentration|Mental Contact||You can fool the senses of others. Make an Illusion check with a Difficulty based on the complexity of the illusion, consulting the table. If successful, the illusion appears to the subject. The illusion exists solely in the subject's mind, so it can be of any size; creating the illusion of something small is just as easy as creating the illusion of something huge.</p><table class="last-row" width="600px"><th>Complexity</th><th class="center">Difficulty</th><tr class="odd-row"><td>Illusion affects a single sense</td><td class="center">10</td></tr><tr><td>Illusion affects two senses</td><td class="center">15</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td>Illusion affects all senses</td><td class="center">20</td></tr><tr><td>Simple (random noise, static image, and the like)</td><td class="center">+0</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td>Complex (coherent sound, moving images, and the like)</td><td class="center">+5</td></tr><tr><td>Very Complex (multiple overlapping sounds or images)</td><td class="center">+10</td></tr></table><p>Since the illusion isn't real, it cannot produce any real effects. It cannot cause damage, support weight, provide nutrition, illuminate darkness, or provide protection from the elements. Thus, characters fall through an illusory bridge or floor if they try to walk on it, and although they can appear to eat, and taste, illusory food, it has no nutritional value.</p><p>Characters encountering an illusion do not get a saving throw against it until they study it carefully or interact with it in some fashion. For example, if characters encounter a section of illusory floor, they would receive a saving throw if they stopped and examined the floor, poked at it, and so forth. Likewise, if an illusory monster attacks the characters, they get a saving throw because they are interacting with the illusion. A successful saving throw against an illusion reveals it to be false, but a translucent after-image remains. For example, a character making a successful saving throw against an illusory section of floor knows the floor isn't real and isn't safe to walk on, and can see what lies below it, but he can still note where the illusion is.</p><p>A failed Will saving throw means the character fails to notice anything is amiss. A character faced with incontrovertible proof that an illusion isn't real needs no saving throw. Someone who falls through an illusory floor knows something is amiss. A character who communicates this information to others gives them a +4 bonus on saving throws against the illusion.|No. You can attempt to affect the same character after some time has passed, but not in the same scene.|Illusion is a full-round action.|
Imbue Life|Fatiguing||||<a href="Powers.php?Name=Cure">Cure</a> rank 12|You can restore the dead to life! The subject cannot have been dead for longer than your power ranks in minutes, and you must make a Difficulty 25 power check, taking a minute of intense concentration. If the check succeeds, the subject's condition becomes unconscious and disabled (from which the subject may heal normally). An Imbue Life attempt is extra-fatiguing, with Difficulty 19 + half your power ranks (round down).|No.|One minute.|
Imbue Unlife|Fatiguing|||||You can lend animation to the dead, creating a mockery of life. Imbue Unlife may create two kinds of undead: mindless or intelligent.</p><p><b>Mindless:</b> You turn the bones or bodies of dead creatures into undead <a href="CreaturesTemplates.php?Name=Skeleton">skeletons</a> or <a href="CreaturesTemplates.php?Name=Zombie">zombies</a>, which obey your spoken commands. They remain animated until destroyed. A destroyed undead creature can't be imbued with unlife again.</p><p>A <a href="CreaturesTemplates.php?Name=Skeleton">skeleton</a> can be created only from a mostly intact corpse or <a href="CreaturesTemplates.php?Name=Skeleton">skeleton</a>. The corpse must have bones. If a <a href="CreaturesTemplates.php?Name=Skeleton">skeleton</a> is made from a corpse, the flesh falls from the bones when it is created. A <a href="CreaturesTemplates.php?Name=Zombie">zombie</a> can be created only from a mostly intact corpse. The corpse must be that of a creature with a true anatomy.</p><p>To determine how many undead you create, make a power check. A result of at least 10 allows you to create a number of undead equal to your power ranks, increasing by 5 for every 5 by which you exceed 10 (round down). You cannot create more undead than the nearby "corpse supply" (ew) will support.</p><p>The <a href="CreaturesTemplates.php?Name=Skeleton">skeletons</a> or <a href="CreaturesTemplates.php?Name=Zombie">zombies</a> you create remain under your control indefinitely. No matter how many times you use this power, however, you can control only two times your total power ranks in levels of mindless undead. If you exceed this, all newly created creatures fall under your control, and any excess from previous castings become uncontrolled. You choose which creatures are released from your control.</p><p><b>Intelligent:</b> You transform a corpse into an intelligent undead creature. Unlike the mindless undead, this creature is not under your control; although, you can use other means, including other powers, to command it. You can create a <a href="Creatures.php?Name=Crypt%20Wight">crypt wight</a> or <a href="Creatures.php?Name=Hopping%20Vampire">hopping vampire</a> using this power. Creating an intelligent undead creature has a Difficulty of 18.</p><p>If you fail an Imbue Unlife check to animate a corpse, that corpse is permanently immune to any further attempts by you to imbue it with unlife.||One minute.|
Immobilize|Fatiguing|||||You can cause creatures to freeze in place, compelling them to stay motionless. With a Difficulty 10 Immobilize check you can paralyze and freeze in place a creature you touch (requiring an attack roll if they are unwilling subjects). The target receives a Will save. If the save is failed, the victim is aware and breathes normally, but cannot take any actions, even speech. Each round on its turn, the victim may, as a full-round action, attempt a new saving throw to end the effect.
Light Shaping|Fatiguing|||||You can mentally control light. With a successful check, you can make your outline blurred and indistinct, or even become invisible.</p><p>You can create realistic three-dimensional images of light occupying up to a 10-foot cube. Each additional 10-foot cube that the image occupies increases the Difficulty by 5. Subjects seeing the image get a Will saving throw to realize it is not real if they have any reason to suspect it, such as the fact that the image makes no noise.</p><p>You can also create a point of light illuminating a 20-foot radius, which you can move at will anywhere in your line of sight as a move action. For each 10 feet you add to the radius of illumination, the Difficulty increases by 5. You can also reverser the effect and suppress light in a 20-foot radius in exactly the same fashion. All creatures in this radius gain concealment (20% miss chance). For each 10 feet you add to the radius of the darkness, the Difficulty increases by 5.</p><p>You can create light effects anywhere in your line of sight, and they last as long as you maintain them. Creating multiple effects at once (such as becoming invisible while also creating the illusion that you are elsewhere) counts as maintaining multiple powers.</p><table width="500px" class="last-row"><th>Task</th><th>Difficulty</th><tr class="odd-row"><td>Illuminate</td><td>5 (+5 per additional 10-foot radius)</td></tr><tr><td>Darkness</td><td>5 (+5 per additional 10-foot radius)</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td>Visual Illusion</td><td>10 (+5 per additional 10-foot cube)</td></tr><tr><td>Blur (20% miss chance)</td><td>15</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td>Blur (50% miss chance)</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Invisibility</td><td>25</td></tr></table><p><b>Special:</b> The basic level of illuminate (Difficulty 5) is not fatiguing.||Light Shaping is a standard action. |
Manipulate Object|Fatiguing|Maintenance||||You can manipulate objects at a distance as if with a pair of invisible, intangible hands. To make use of an object with this power, make a power check and compare to this table to see if you can lift it.</p><table width="200px"><th class="center">Difficulty</th><th class="center">Mass</th><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">10</td><td class="center">2 lb.</td></tr><tr><td class="center">15</td><td class="center">5 lb.</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">20</td><td class="center">10 lb.</td></tr></table><p>You cannot use an object heavier than 10 pounds with Manipulate Object.</p><p>You can use your normal <a href="Skills.php">skills</a> via Manipulate Object, but you are at a -4 penalty for having to operate remotely, and you can't perform tasks at all if you can't see your target, since your power has no sense of touch. You may reduce the penalty by 1 for every five points your Manipulate Object check exceeded 10.</p><p><b>Remotely Wielding Weapons:</b> An adept can wield a weapon using Manipulate Object. Picking up the weapon is a move action. Attacking with it is a standard action. <a href="CombatModifiers.php?Name=Concealment">Concealment</a> is determined by the attacker and defender's positions, not the weapon's, while <a href="CombatModifiers.php?Name=Cover">cover</a> is determined by the defender and weapon's positions. The attacker makes a normal <a href="Combat.php#AttackBonus">attack roll</a>, but with a -4 penalty for the difficulty in controlling the weapon from afar (modified by the power check as noted above), and adds his Intelligence score to the attack roll, rather than Dexterity. The weapon deals its normal damage with no modification for Strength (as if wielded by a Str 0 attacker).</p><p>A remotely wielded weapon can be struck normally by <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Sunder">sunder</a> attacks. Attempts to <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Disarm">disarm</a> the remote wielder by knocking the weapon out of his supernatural "grasp" are resolved against a Difficulty of the wielder's effective power bonus, if the wielder's Manipulate Object bonus is greater than his <a href="Combat.php#ManeuverBonus">Maneuver Difficulty</a>.||Manipulate Object is a move action. The power use lasts for one round per power rank. |
Metal Shaping|Fatiguing|||||You can shape, damage, and repair metal objects.</p><p><b>Keen Edge	(Difficulty 10):</b> This effect makes a weapon supernaturally keen, improving its ability to deal telling blows. This effect doubles the critical threat range of the weapon. A threat range of 20 becomes 19-20, a threat range of 19-20 becomes 17-20, and a threat range of 18-20 becomes 15-20. This effect can be cast only on piercing or slashing weapons with metal edges, and lasts until the end of the scene. Multiple effects that increase a weapon's threat range (such as the <a href="Feats.php?Name=Improved%20Critical">Improved Critical</a> feat) don't stack with this use of Metal Shaping.</p><p><b>Metalworking (Difficulty 10):</b> You can mold metal into any shape you wish. You can affect 1 cubic foot of metal. Each addition cubic foot increases the Difficulty by 1 (so at Difficulty 20, you can affect 20 cubic feet). The Narrator may require a <a href="Skills.php?Name=Craft">Craft (metalworking)</a> check to achieve precise results. YOu perform metalworking crafts in minutes instead of hte hours of normal Craft projects. A complex project, which normally takes 24 hours, would therefore take 24 minutes.</p><p><b>Corrode (Difficulty 15):</b> You can damage metal objects with a thought. A targeted metal object suffers damage equal to half your Metal Shaping ranks (rounded down) unless it succeeds on a Difficulty 15 Reflex save. Carried, worn or otherwise attended objects can use their possessor's saving throw, if it is better. Metallic creatures are not affected by this use of the power.</p><p><b>Mending (Difficulty 15):</b> You can repair damaged metal objects. This requires you to touch the object and make a Difficulty 15 Metal Shaping check. If you succeed, the object is restored to its full Toughness. You may also attempt to heal metallic creatures with this power. In this case you can treat your Metal Shaping power like the <a href="Powers.php?Name=Cure">Cure</a> power.</p><p><b>Implode Armor (Difficulty 30):</b> this use of Metal Shaping requires both concentration and maintenance. You can cause a suit of metal armor within your line of sight to begin slowly crumpling in on itself. The wearer suffers +2 damage on the first round, +4 damage on the second round, and +8 damage on each round after that until they are able to remove their armor, they have died, or until the caster discontinues this use of the power. This effect can be prevented with a successful Fortitude save.</p>||Metalworking depends on the project in question. Keen Edge, Mending and Corrode are standard actions. Implode Armor is a standard action that must be maintained each round that the effect continues to be active.|
Mind Probe|Fatiguing||Concentration|Mental Contact||You can mentally probe a subject's mind for information. The target gets a Will save.</p><p>If the target fails the save, you can ask any one question and receive the answer from the target's mind. If the target doesn't know the answer, then you know that. Especially personal or guarded information grants the target a +1 to +5 bonus on the Will save, while information the subject doesn't consciously know (because it is subconscious or forgotten due to amnesia, for example) grants a +5 to +10 bonus on the Will save.</p><p>You can continue to ask questions, one per round, for as long as you maintain your Mind Probe. Each question requires an additional Will save by the target and another Resilience roll on your part.|Yes, but the target gets a cumulative +1 bonus to the Will save for each new attempt in the same scene.|Mind Probe is a full-round action. |
Mind Reading|Fatiguing|Maintenance||Mental Contact||You can read another creature's thoughts. The target makes a Will save. If the target fails the save, you can read the target's surface thoughts (whatever the target is presently thinking). Mind Reading transcends language; you comprehend the target's thoughts whether or not you share a language. If you fail your Mind Reading check, you cannot read the target's mind.</p><p>If you can interact with your subject, a successful <a href="Skills.php?Name=Bluff">Bluff</a> check against the target's <a href="Skills.php?Name=Sense%20Motive">Sense Motive</a> check causes the subject to think consciously about a particular piece of information you're looking for, such as a password or name, allowing you to pluck it from the subject's surface thoughts.</p><p><b>Sense Minds:</b> You can determine the presence and location of other minds. Make a Difficulty 15 Mind Reading check to sense the presence of any creature with an Intelligence score within 30 feet of you. For every factor of 10 you extend your sensing radius, the Difficulty increases by 5.</p><table class="last-row" width="400px"><th class="center">Difficulty</th><th>Radius</th><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">15</td><td>30 feet</td></tr><tr><td class="center">20</td><td>300 feet</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">25</td><td>3,000 feet (about one-half mile)</td></tr><tr><td class="center">30</td><td>30,000 feet (about 5 miles)</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">35</td><td>300,000 feet (about 50 miles)</td></tr><tr><td class="center">40</td><td>3,000,000 feet (about 500 miles)</td></tr></table><p>With a successful check, you sense the presence of other minds, their approximate number, their general type (animal, humanoid, and so forth), and their approximate location.

Mind Shaping|Fatiguing|||Mental Contact||Mind Shaping allows you to remove psychic influence or to alter memories and behavior. Make a Mind Shaping check, with the Difficulty determined by the task.</p><p><b>Remove Mental Influence:</b> Make a Mind Shaping check with a Difficulty equal to the check result of a mind-affecting power. If you succeed, that power no longer affects the subject. Note this only removes the effects of ongoing powers, not permanent aftereffects. This means you could use Mind Shaping to remove a <a href="Powers.php?Name=Dominate">Dominate</a> or <a href="Powers.php?Name=Illusion">Illusion</a> effect, but not to restore damage caused by a psychic attack (for that, use the <a href="Powers.php?Name=Cure">Cure</a> power). You can undo the effects of Mind Shaping used to alter the subject's mind by equaling or exceeding the Mind Shaping check used to make the alterations.</p><p><b>Alter Psyche:</b> You can make changes in the subject's mind. The Difficulty is based on the extent of the change you wish to make. False or altered memories can cause dissonance within the subject's mind, depending on how well they fit into the subject's other memories. If the subject notices a conflict between the false and true memories (Narrator's discretion), she gets an additional Will save to shake off the effect and regain her true memory.

Mind Link||Maintenance|Concentration|||You can establish contact with another mind. The base Difficulty is 10, modified by familiarity. If the subject has a <a href="Powers.php?Name=Psychic%20Shield">Psychic Shield</a>, you have to make a separate Mind Link check to overcome it. An unwilling subject also gets a Will saving throw to avoid contact. If the save is successful, no contact is made.</p><p>If you do not want the subject to know you are making mental contact, you can make a separate opposed Mind Link check against the subject's <a href="Skills.php?Name=Sense%20Motive">Sense Motive</a>, <a href="Powers.php?Name=Second%20Sight">Second Sight</a>, or <a href="Powers.php?Name=Psychic%20Shield">Psychic Shield</a> check (whichever has the highest bonus). If you win, the subject is unaware of your attempt. If the subject wins, she is aware of your attempt (whether you succeed or fail in actually establishing contact).</p><p>While you are in mental contact with another being, the two of you can communicate at the rate of normal speech, hearing each other's thoughts. You can also send a single visual image each round instead of speaking. Both you and the subject can choose to lie or omit information; you're "speaking" to each other mentally, not reading each other's thoughts. Mind Link is two-way, meaning you are in mental contact with the subject for purposes of her powers and vice versa.</p><p>If a friendly mental contact turns hostile, the subject can make a Will saving throw or <a href="Powers.php?Name=Psychic%20Shield">Psychic Shield</a> check to break contact. Once the subject has failed an attempt to eject the intruder from her mind, she can't break the contact.</p><p>If your Mind Link is broken, any other powers you are maintaining requiring mental contact are also broken.</p><p><b>Mentally Aiding Others:</b> While in mental contact with another character, you can use the <a href="Basics.php#Aid">aid action</a> (a standard action) to grant that character a +2 bonus on Will saving throws or on any skill check where your skill rank is equal to or greater than the subject's.</p><p><b>Mental Rapport:</b> Two or more characters with Mind Link can enter a mental rapport with each other, a deep and very intense state of mental contact. Each character establishes mental contact with the other, each of whom must be a willing participant. Characters in rapport are like one mind, each instantly aware of everything that the other thinks and experiences and able to share information instantly. Characters in rapport cannot deliberately lie to or deceive each other.</p><p><b>Mental Grapple:</b> With the Mind Link power you can attempt to <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Mental%20Grapple">mentally grapple</a> another creature. You can attempt to freeze them in place or even drive them unconscious with your Mind Link power.</p><p><b>Deathcry:</b> If a creature you are in mental contact with dies, you must make a Will saving throw or <a href="Powers.php?Name=Psychic%20Shield">Psychic Shield</a> check (Difficulty 20) to avoid being dazed for 1 round by the psychic feedback and trauma. Since mental contact is a two-way phenomenon, this applies to any creature in mental contact with another, including all the creatures involved in a Mental Rapport. A creature can deliberately avoid letting out a deathcry when it dies by making a Will saving throw (Difficulty 20).|You can retry Mind Link freely, but retries on the same subject within the same scene are fatiguing. A use of Mind Link ends at the end of the current scene.|Mind Link is a move action. It requires concentration to maintain. |
Move Object|Fatiguing|Maintenance||||You can move objects with the power of your thoughts. A Move Object check allows you to move an object in your line of sight. The Difficulty of the Move Object check is based on the mass of the object you want to move and whether or not you choose to risk fatigue. A fatiguing use of Move Object can move ten times the mass listed on the table (so 20 pounds at Difficulty 10, up to 2,000 pounds at Difficulty 40) and doubles the listed damage.</p><table width="300px"><th class="center">Difficulty</th><th class="center">Mass</th><th class="center">Damage</th><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">10</td><td class="center">2 lb.</td><td class="center">+1</td></tr><tr><td class="center">15</td><td class="center">5 lb.</td><td class="center">+2</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">20</td><td class="center">10 lb.</td><td class="center">+3</td></tr><tr><td class="center">25</td><td class="center">25 lb.</td><td class="center">+4</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">30</td><td class="center">50 lb.</td><td class="center">+5</td></tr><tr><td class="center">35</td><td class="center">100 lb.</td><td class="center">+6</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">40</td><td class="center">200 lb.</td><td class="center">+7</td></tr></table><p>You can move the object a distance of 5 feet times your Move Object rank per move action.</p><p>If two adepts vie for control of an object, use opposed Move Object checks. The winner controls the object for that round. If a creature is holding the object, make a Move Object check opposed by the creature's Strength check.</p><p><b>Grappling Creatures:</b> You can use Move Object to <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Grapple">grapple</a> a creature. If you successfully <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Pinned">pin</a> your target, you can treat them as an ordinary object for purposes of moving them with this ability.</p><p><b>Striking with Objects:</b> You can hurl objects at opponents. This requires a ranged attack roll and the object deals damage based on your Move Object skill check, as shown on the table. Since using Move Object is a move action, you can move an object and strike with it (as a standard action) in the same round.</p><p><b>Moving Multiple Objects:</b> As a full-round action, you can attempt to move multiple objects at once. Use the Difficulty of the heaviest object, then add +2 for each additional object and increase the fatigue check Difficulty by +2 for each additional object. You cannot strike a target with multiple objects as part of the same action.||Move Object is a move action. The power use lasts until the end of the current scene and requires concentration to maintain. |
Nature Reading||||||You are attuned to the flows of the natural world, able to read certain signs from it. You can learn the following:</p><ul><li>With a Difficulty 10 power check, you can immediately (as a reaction) identify any animal or plant, or tell if water in a natural environment is safe to drink.</li><li>With a minute of observation and a Difficulty 15 check, you can accurately predict the weather for one day for every 5 points you exceed the Difficulty.</li><li>Once per scene with 10 minutes of meditation, you can learn any three facts about the following: the ground or terrain, plants, minerals, bodies of water, people, general animal population, presence of animals, presence of powerful unnatural creatures, or the general state of the natural setting. This covers a 1-mile radius for every 5 points your power check exceeds Difficulty 10.</li></ul>||See the description.|
Object Reading||||||You can read psychic impressions from places and objects, getting images of their pasts, as if you were actually present at a particular past event.</p><p><b>Active Object Reading:</b> You can attempt to see the past of a particular place or object. You must be able to touch the object. This requires a full-round action and an Object Reading check. Active Object Reading is fatiguing. Note that if the object is imbued with <a href="EquipmentSupernatural.php">supernatural power</a>, you will be aware that it is supernatural, but you will need to make a second Object Reading check to activate the <em>Determine Powers</em> use.</p><p><b>Spontaneous Visions:</b> Your ability may also spontaneously activate at the Narrator's discretion when you are in contact with an object with particularly strong psychic impressions. This requires an Object Reading check.</p><p>Consult the table below for the results of a vision, based on the Object Reading check.</p><table class="last-row"><th width="15%" class="center">Difficulty</th><th>Result</th><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">10</td><td>A vague vision that may not be accurate.</td></tr><tr><td class="center">15</td><td>A brief and accurate vision of the events.</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">20</td><td>A longer vision of the events, encompassing everything that took place in a particular place and time.</td></tr><tr><td class="center">25</td><td>The ability to move the vision backward or forward in time to review the event.</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">30</td><td>The ability to track the vision backward through time and space to trace an event to its origin.</td></tr><tr><td class="center">35</td><td>Near-complete knowledge of a particular past event and everything involving it.</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Determine Powers:</b> You can attempt to determine the exact properties of a supernatural item. The Difficulty for this check is equal to either 10 + the power bonus of the power, or equal to the save Difficulty of the power.</p><p>Impressions read from objects generally count as slightly familiar for the purposes of determining familiarity for other powers, possibly more if the vision was long or extremely accurate (in the Narrator's opinion).||Object Reading is a full-round action. |
Pain|Fatiguing||Concentration|Mental Contact||You can inflict terrible pain on a target. You must touch or be in mental contact with the target, who makes a Will saving throw. If the save fails, the target is stunned. So long as you maintain concentration, the effect continues. The victim gets a new Will save each round to overcome the pain. A successful Will save means your Pain power stops working. You must use it again to affect the target (with the usual increase in Resilience roll Difficulty for successive use). A target gets a +2 Will save bonus for each successive use of Pain in the same scene.||Pain is a standard action. |
Phase|Fatiguing|Maintenance||||You can shift yourself "out of phase" with the material world, becoming <a href="CreaturesSubTypes.php?Name=Incorporeal">incorporeal</a>. You are unaffected by the material world, able to pass through solid objects and creatures and move in any direction, including up or down, at half your normal movement speed. Attacks originating in the material world do not affect you, but you cannot touch or affect material things either. Supernatural powers that affect the mind or spirit still work on you and your supernatural powers of the same type work on material beings, so you can <a href="Powers.php?Name=Psychic%20Blast">Psychic Blast</a> a material creature while using Phase, for example, and they can <a href="Powers.php?Name=Psychic%20Blast">Psychic Blast</a> you, but you cannot use <a href="Powers.php?Name=Move%20Object">Move Object</a> or other powers affecting the material world, nor can you use the <a href="Powers.php?Name=Summon%20Spirit">Summon Spirit</a> power while you are out of phase.</p><p>If you carry additional mass along with you, make a Power check with the Difficulty based on the amount, as follows:</p><table width="300px"><th class="center">Difficulty</th><th>Mass</th><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">15</td><td>up to 10 lb.</td></tr><tr><td class="center">20</td><td>20 lb.</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">25</td><td>50 lb.</td></tr><tr><td class="center">30</td><td>100 lb.</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">35</td><td>250 lb.</td></tr></table><p>You choose whether objects you are touching are pased as well or left behind (allowing you to phase out of things such as rope or manacles, or your clothes, for example). You cannot phase only part of an object or creature. All the material must be touching you or another solid object that is touching you in order to be phased. Creatures that do not wish to be phased can make a Will save, with success meaning they remain solid.</p><p>You remain out of phase for one round per power rank (this number must be the same as the ranks used to make a power check for additional mass, as noted above). If the power's duration ends while you are inside a material object, you are shunted into the nearest open space and must make a Toughness saving throw against +1 damager per 5 feet you travel in this manner. You can also renew your power's duration with a new Resilience roll.||Phase is a move action|
Plant Shaping|Fatiguing|||||You can shape living plants and, to a degree, dead wood and other plant materials.</p><p><b>Plant Healing:</b> You can heal injured or diseased plants. This requires you to touch the plant and make a Difficulty 15 Plant Shaping check. If you succeed, the plant is restored to health. Plants must be living and reasonably intact in order for this power to heal them.</p><p><b>Plant Growth:</b> You can promote rapid growth in plants, causing an area to become filled with thick undergrowth (see <a href="PlayingPhysical.php#HamperedMovement">Hampered Movement</a>). This affects a radius equal to your power ranks times 20 feet. You can also focus the power on a specific area with a 20-foot radius. Plants there become so overgrown they entangle anyone in the area, who must make a Reflex saving throw. A failed save means the target is bound and helpless, needing a Difficulty 20 Strength or Escape Artist check to get free. A successful save means the target isn't trapped, but must still contend with the thick undergrowth created by the tangled plants. Finally, you can use plant growth to enrich an area with a radius equal to your power ranks times 200 feet, increasing the yield and growth of crops there by 50 percent for the season.</p><p><b>Woodcrafting:</b> You can use Plant Shaping like a <a href="Skills.php?Name=Craft">Craft</a> skill to shape objects out of wood. This takes minutes instead of the hours of a normal <a href="Skills.php?Name=Craft">Craft</a> project. You can therefore complete a simple woodcraft project in a minute and an advanced one in an hour. See the <a href="Skills.php?Name=Craft">Craft skill</a> for details.||Plant healing is a full-round action. Plant growth is a standard action. Woodcrafting requires time based on the project (as noted above).|
Psychic Blast|Fatiguing|||||You can focus your power to psychically assault a target's mind. You can affect any target in your line of sight or in mental contact. The target makes a Will saving throw against your power's save Difficulty, with the results noted as <a href="CombatDamage.php#NonLethalDamage">non-lethal damage</a>. So a failed Will save results in a <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Bruised">bruise</a>, failure by 5 or more in a <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Dazed">daze</a>, and so forth. Psychic Blast cannot cause damage past <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Unconscious">unconsciousness</a>.||Psychic Blast is a standard action. |
Psychic Reflection|||||<a href="Powers.php?Name=Psychic%20Shield">Psychic Shield</a>|You can reflect powers blocked by your <a href="Powers.php?Name=Psychic%20Shield">Psychic Shield</a> back at their originator. When your <a href="Powers.php?Name=Psychic%20Shield">Psychic Shield</a> successfully blocks a power directed at you, you can make a Psychic Reflection check against the same Difficulty. If you succeed, the power directed at you affects the attacker instead, using the attacker's bonus. You do not suffer fatigue for the reflected power (the attacker does), but you are in control of the effect. You must maintain the power yourself (if it can be maintained), and it has its normal effect and duration. The attacker may defend and save against the reflected power normally but cannot also reflect it using Psychic Reflection. Any attempt to do so simply causes the power's effect to dissipate.||Psychic Reflection is a reaction.|
Psychic Shield||||||You can shield your mind from psychic influences. When you are the target of a power granting a Will saving throw, make a Psychic Shield check. The attacker must make a power check using the attacking power. If your check result is higher, the power fails. If the attacker's result is higher, the power affects you normally, but you still get your normal saving throw.</p><p>You may choose to voluntarily lower your Psychic Shield as a free action, and can raise it again as a free action. Otherwise, your shield is always active, even if you are unconscious or sleeping.</p><p><b>Shields and Maintained Powers:</b> Once a power has overcome your Psychic Shield, it continues to affect you as long as the user maintains it. You're still entitled to your normal saving throws, if any, but your shield no longer protects you from that power. Once the attacker needs to make a new power check, however, your shield comes into play again and must be overcome again. For powers requiring mental contact, so long as the other adept remains in mental contact with you (inside your shield), he can use those powers freely without worrying about your shield.</p><p><b>Overcoming Psychic Shields:</b> An attacker can choose to suffer a fatigue result to gain a +5 bonus to overcome your Psychic Shield. This is in addition to any fatigue caused by the power used against you. If you also choose to suffer a fatigue result, the attacker loses the bonus and must roll normally to overcome your shield. This process takes no actual time; it happens as part of the check to overcome the Psychic Shield. An attacker trying to avoid notice cannot use this option, since it makes it immediately apparent that you are under psychic attack.||Using Psychic Shield as a defense is a reaction; raising or lowering your shield is a free action. |
Psychic Trap|||||<a href="Powers.php?Name=Psychic%20Shield">Psychic Shield</a>|You can psychically act against anyone who tries to overcome your psychic defenses. When an opponent attempts to use a power against you and fails to overcome your <a href="Powers.php?Name=Psychic%20Shield">Psychic Shield</a>, you get an immediate power use against the attacker as a reaction. This can be any power you can use as a standard or move action, but not a full-round action. If the power requires mental contact, you are considered in mental contact with your opponent for the purposes of using it. You only get one free power use per opponent per round, regardless of the number of attempts to overcome your <a href="Powers.php?Name=Psychic%20Shield">Psychic Shield</a>. The reactive power has its normal Difficulty and fatigue.||Psychic Trap is a reaction. |
Psychic Weapon|Fatiguing|Maintenance||||You can create a melee weapon out of psychic energy. Take a move action to create the psychic weapon in your hand. The appearance of the weapon is up to you; its effects are the same regardless. You wield a psychic weapon like a normal melee weapon, except you are automatically considered trained with it.</p><p>The psychic weapon inflicts +1 damage per 4 power ranks. Add your key ability for Psychic Weapon rather than your Strength to the weapon's damage. This damage ignores physical armor. You can score a critical hit with your Psychic Weapon on a natural roll of 20, inflicting an additional +3 damage.</p><p>A psychic weapon is immaterial and only affects creatures with an Intelligence score. It has no effect on non-intelligent creatures or objects, meaning it cannot <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Sunder">sunder</a> or even <a href="Combat.php#Parry">parry</a> a material weapon. Two psychic weapons affect each other normally. If your psychic weapon is somehow knocked from your grasp or sundered by another psychic weapon, you can recreate it by taking a move action to do so.</p><p>The weapon lasts for one round per power rank after you summon it. Your psychic weapon disappears if you are <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Stunned">stunned</a> or <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Unconscious">unconscious</a>.||Creating a Psychic Weapon is a move action.|
Scrying|Fatiguing||Concentration|||You can sense distant events as if you were physically present at them. Make a Scrying check to sense a particular place, creature, or thing known to you. The base Difficulty is 10, modified by familiarity. If successful, you can observe the subject as if you were present. The vision lasts for as long as you maintain it, but your ordinary senses are overridden, so you are unaware of what is happening near you while you are observing events elsewhere. A subject observed via Scrying is considered present in terms of familiarity, but not in your actual line of sight.</p><p>Scrying creates a psychic disturbance, which creatures with Intelligence 0 or better can sense. Any such creature under observation can make a <a href="Skills.php?Name=Sense%20Motive">Sense Motive</a> or <a href="Powers.php?Name=Second%20Sight">Second Sight</a> check, opposed by your Scrying check. Creatures with no supernatural abilities get the intense feeling of being watched. Creatures with power ranks see a glowing or shadowy image of you. You also have a present familiarity for any creature that senses you for the purposes of that creature's powers, meaning they may affect you in return.||Scrying is a full-round action. |
Second Sight||||||You can sense the use and lingering effects of supernatural powers. Make a Second Sight check to detect powers in use in your vicinity, to sense an attempt at mental contact, or to detect and read the supernatural "signature" left behind by powers. You can also use this power to detect spirits in the area.</p><p><b>Sense Powers:</b> The Narrator makes a Second Sight check for you in secret as a reaction whenever supernatural powers are used in your general area. The base Difficulty is 10 or the user's <a href="Powers.php?Name=Psychic%20Shield">Psychic Shield</a> check result, whichever is greater, and the Difficulty increases by +1 for every 10 feet between you and the user or subject of the power (whichever is closer). A successful result means you sense the power use. You also know the general direction and distance to the source of the power and its target. If you succeed by 5 or more, you know which power was used. If you succeed by 10 or more, you also recognize the user, if known to you.</p><p><b>Sense Mind Link:</b> You make a Second Sight check against the other's <a href="Powers.php?Name=Mind%20Link">Mind Link</a> check to know when someone is trying to secretly get into mental contact with you. If you win the check, you sense the attempt, but you might not be able to avoid it (depending on the results of your <a href="Powers.php?Name=Psychic%20Shield">Psychic Shield</a> check and Will save).</p><p><b>Sense Supernatural Signature:</b> If you also have the Object Reading power, you can sense old uses of supernatural powers in an area. The base Second Sight Difficulty is 15 to detect that powers were used in the area in the past, and 20 to determine what power was used and roughly when. It is Difficulty 25 to know exactly what or whom the power was used on. Sensing supernatural signatures is fatiguing.</p><p><b>Detect Spirits:</b> You make a Second Sight check to detect the presence of any <a href="CreatureTypes.php?Name=Spirit">spirit creatures</a> in the area. The base Second Sight Difficulty is 15 to detect that spirits exist nearby. It is Difficulty 25 to know details about the spirits such as their names (if any), any skills, feats or powers they may possess, or any mortals they may be assisting.|No.|Sensing power use and mental contact are reactions, taking no time. Sensing signatures and spirits requires a full-round action.|
Self-Shaping|Fatiguing||||<a href="Powers.php?Name=Body%20Control">Body Control</a> rank 12|You can reshape your body to assume the form of another creature. The new form must be a humanoid or animal, with a level no greater than your total level.</p><p>If you are slain or knocked unconscious while using this ability, you revert to your original form. You gain the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of the new form, but retain your own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also gain the new form's speed and qualities, and you retain your own base combat bonus, saving throws, and skills (modified by your new ability scores).</p><p>You can freely designate the new form's cosmetic qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, and skin color, for example) within the normal ranges for a creature of that type. The new form's significant physical qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under your control, but must fall within the norms for the new form's species. You are effectively disguised as an average member of that species. If you use this ability to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your <a href="Skills.php?Name=Disguise">Disguise</a> check.</p><p>Your equipment is not affected by the transformation. Any clothing or equipment that cannot be worn by your new form drops off. Likewise, when you return to your normal form, you have only what you are carrying or wearing. This usually leaves you naked if you were in animal form. At the Narrator's discretion, some supernatural items may disappear into your changed form, reappearing when you assume your normal form.</p><p>It requires a full-round action to undergo a transformation, during which you can do nothing else. The transformation lasts for one hour per power rank, but you can make an additional fatigue save to maintain a form for another hour per power rank.</p><p>Assuming a shape with an average species Intelligence lower than your species poses an additional danger: each hour you must make a Will saving throw (Difficulty 15) or lose a point of Intelligence. If your Intelligence score drops to the natural level for that species, you become that creature in mind, as well as body. The effect of your Self-Shaping becomes permanent, and your normal identity is lost. You remain trapped until someone else achieves a Difficulty 30 Mind Link to reach and reawaken your normal self, allowing you to return to normal form.|||
Severance|Fatiguing|||Mental Contact|<a href="Powers.php?Name=Ward">Ward</a> rank 13|You can remove another creature's supernatural powers. You must be in mental contact with the subject. Make a <a href="Powers.php?Name=Ward">Ward</a> check (Difficulty 30) as a full-round action to deprive the subject of powers. The target makes a Will saving throw against your power save Difficulty. If the check succeeds and the Will save fails, the subject loses use of all supernatural powers, while retaining knowledge of those abilities. The target gets an additional Will save each day to regain lost powers, and a use of <a href="Powers.php?Name=Mind%20Shaping">Mind Shaping</a> or another use of this power can reverse the effect (Difficulty 30). You can only take 10 or 20 on the <a href="Powers.php?Name=Ward">Ward</a> check if the target is helpless. |
Sleep|Fatiguing|||Mental Contact||You can psychically put a target into a deep sleep. The target gets a Will saving throw. Success negates the effect. If the Will save fails, the creature falls instantly asleep and remains so until the end of the current scene. Sleeping creatures are helpless. Slapping or any damage awakens them, but normal noise does not. Awakening the creature requires a standard action. Creatures that do not normally sleep are unaffected by this power.||Sleep is a standard action. It lasts until the end of the current scene. |
Suggestion|Fatiguing|||||You can implant suggestions into the minds of others. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable. Asking a creature to shoot or stab itself, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act automatically fails. However, a suggestion that a pool of acid is actually pure water and that a quick dip would be refreshing is another matter.</p><p>If the target's Will saving throw fails, the suggested course of action is followed for up to 30 minutes per power rank, or until the course of action is complete, whichever comes first. You can also specify conditions that trigger a particular course of action, in which case the duration is counted from when the triggering event occurs. A very reasonable suggestion may impose a saving throw penalty of -1 or -2, at the Narrator's discretion.|No. You can attempt to affect the same character after some time has passed, but not in the same scene.|Suggestion is a full-round action. It lasts for 30 minutes per rank.|
Summon Spirit|Fatiguing||Concentration|||You can summon a spirit to engage in combat for you, to provide you with supernatural assistance, or simply to obey your commands. The spirit will remain with you for one round per power rank, until you stop maintaining the power, or until it is destroyed.</p><p><strong>Combat:</strong> You may choose to summoun a spirit creature filled with rage and fury, that will attack whoever you indicate until the power finishes. This spirit may appear in any fashion you wish (although it may not replicate specific individuals), and enters into combat as a <a href="CombatModifiers.php?Name=Minions">minion</a> with a level equal to your power check minus 15. The minimum level of the summouned spirit is one. All rules associated with minions apply -- so your spirit will be destroyed if it ever fails a Toughness save. If your concentration fails, the spirit disappears.</p><p><strong>Supernatural Assistance:</strong> You may choose to summoun a spirit creature that can exert some influence on the world through a supernatural power. Choose a power when you summoun the spirit and make a power check. Your spirit has a number of ranks equal to your power check minus ten. A spirit can indeed have negative ranks in a power, so there is no minimum. A spirit has no modifiers on its power check beyond the number of ranks. With an influence (<a href="Skills.php?Name=Diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> or <a href="Skills.php?Name=Intimidate">Intimidate</a>) check (Difficulty equal to your Summoun Spirit check result) you can direct the spirit to use its power as you wish. Each time you wish the spirit to use its power (or if you wish the spirit to maintain a power for another round) you must make another influence check. The spirit's powers are cast by the spirit, not by you, so powers that affect the self (<a href="Powers.php?Name=Enhance+Ability">Enhance Ability</a>, for example) affect the spirit, not you. The spirit's powers have a Save Difficulty of 9 plus half the spirit's ranks. If you cease concentrating, the spirit disappears.</p><p><strong>Spirit Creature:</strong> If you wish, you may use this power to summoun a spirit creature of a more significant type. To summon such a spirit, make a power check with a Difficulty of 10 + the level of the spirit. The summoning lasts a full round, at the end of which the spirit appears. The spirit is not bound to obey you, so you must convince it to do your will using either <a href="Skills.php?Name=Diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> or <a href="Skills.php?Name=Intimidate">Intimidate</a>. If you cannot convince the spirit to do your bidding, it may remain in the area it was summoned for one round per level, and it may do whatever it wishes (including attack you). You may dismiss the spirit at any time, although if it is unwilling to go, it gets a Will save. If you cease concentrating, the spirit can likewise remain in the area it was summouned for one round per level, again doing whatever it wishes. You cannot regain control of a spirit you have ceased concentrating on without using a power such as <a href="Powers.php?Name=Dominate">Dominate</a>.</p><p>Usually the spirit summoned is not one of <a href="Creatures.php?Type=Spirit">the described creatures of the spirit type</a>, but a more generic creature of that type. Use the rules in the <a href="CreaturesTypes.php?Name=Spirit">spirit type description</a> to create your spirit.||Summon Spirit is a full-round action.|
Supernatural Speed|Fatiguing||||<a href="Powers.php?Name=Body%20Control">Body Control</a>|You can move at great speed in short bursts. When you use this feat, make a power check. For every 5 points of your check, your speed increases by 10 ft. (so a character with a base speed of 30 ft. per round will go 40 ft. per round with a check of 5 or less, 50 ft. with a result of 6-10, 60 ft. with a result of 11-15, and so on). You also multiply your <a href="Skills.php?Name=Jump">Jump</a> distance by half your ranks.</p><p>Each use of Supernatural Speed lasts for only one round.||Supernatural Speed is a move action.|
Teleport|Fatiguing|||||You can move instantly from one place to another without crossing the distance in between. Make a Teleport power check, the base Difficulty is 20, plus the familiarity of your destination. If you carry additional mass along with you, the Difficulty is based on the amount, as follows:</p><table width="300px"><th class="center">Difficulty</th><th>Mass</th><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">20</td><td>up to 10 lb.</td></tr><tr><td class="center">25</td><td>20 lb.</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">30</td><td>50 lb.</td></tr><tr><td class="center">35</td><td>100 lb.</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">40</td><td>250 lb.</td></tr></table><p>You choose whether objects you are touching are carried along or left behind (allowing you to teleport out of things such as rope or manacles, or your clothes, for example). You cannot teleport only part of an object or creature. All the material must be touching you or another solid object that is touching you in order to be carried along. Creatures that do not wish to be teleported can make a Will save, with success meaning they're left behind. A failed power check means you don't go anywhere, but still suffer normal fatigue.||Teleport is a full-round action.|
Truth-Reading|Fatiguing|||||You can sense when someone is lying to you. When interacting with a creature of Intelligence -3 or higher, you automatically sense when the creature tells you a deliberate lie. You do not detect half-truths, lies of omission, or things the creature believes are true (even if they are not).</p><p>Truth-Reading lasts a number of rounds equal to your power ranks.|||
Visions||||||You can get visions of the future, as if you were actually present at a particular future event. The visions you receive are by no means assured; the future can be changed by the actions of those in the present.</p><p><b>Spontaneous Visions:</b> At the Narrator's discretion, you may receive a vision when you are in contact with a subject or when there is a momentous event approaching in the future. This vision can occur while you are awake, yet spontaneous visions often take the form of dreams. You know when a dream is actually a vision, although you may not necessarily know what the vision means.</p><p><b>Danger Sense:</b> Whenever you would normally be surprised in combat, you can make a Visions check (Difficulty 15). If successful, you receive a split-second warning; you are not surprised and can take an action during the surprise round.</p><p>The Narrator should make Visions checks secretly so the player doesn't know if a particular vision is accurate or not. Consult the table for the results of a vision, based on the Visions check, or choose a suitable result, based on the hero's Visions rank and the requirements of the story.</p><table class="last-row" width="600px"><th width="15%" class="center">Difficulty</th><th>Result</th><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">10</td><td>A vague vision of the future that may be accurate.</td></tr><tr><td class="center">15</td><td>An accurate glimpse of the future.</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">20</td><td>Awareness of how long before a event occurs.</td></tr><tr><td class="center">25</td><td>Awareness of the people involved in a future event.</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td class="center">30</td><td>Awareness of the time, subjects, and location of a future event.</td></tr><tr><td class="center">35</td><td>Near-complete knowledge of a future event and everything involving it.</td></tr></table><p>Things seen in visions count as slightly familiar in terms of familiarity, possibly more if the vision was long or extremely accurate (in the Narrator's opinion).||Visions is a full-round action (at least). |
Ward|||Concentration|||You can create interference with other supernatural powers and even creatures. You can affect an area around you with a radius equal to your power ranks times 5 feet. Alternatively, you can choose to focus your Ward against a single creature in your line of sight.</p><p>Anyone affected by your Ward must make an opposed check against the result of your Ward check to successfully use any powers. Powers with results less than yours fail; although, the users of the failed powers still suffer fatigue, if any. Opponents can choose to suffer a fatigue result, in addition to the normal fatigue of the power used, to gain a +5 bonus to overcome your Ward. If so, you can choose to suffer a fatigue result to reinforce your ward, forcing the subject to make a normal check to overcome it (without the bonus). This takes no actual time; it happens as part of the check to overcome the Ward.</p><p><b>Creature Ward:</b> You can also use Ward to "hedge out" or ward off certain supernatural creatures such as <a href="CreaturesTypes.php?Name=Undead">undead</a> or <a href="CreaturesTypes.php?Name=Spirit">spirits</a>. Any creature affected by your Ward must make a Will save against the result of your Ward check to pass the boundary of the ward (a radius of power ranks x 5 feet). A creature that fails the save cannot cross the boundary so long as the ward is maintained, nor can it directly affect or influence anything within the bounds of the ward.||Ward is a move action.|
Water Shaping|Fatiguing|Maintenance||||You can shape and direct the flow of water.</p><p><b>Splash:</b> You can cause as much as 10 gallons of water per Water Shaping rank to leap in an arc up to 10 feet per power rank. Hitting a creature with this watery arc requires a ranged attack roll. The creature must make a Fortitude save or be <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Dazed">dazed</a> for one round (taking no actions but defending normally). The splash also douses flames with a damage bonus less than your Water Shaping rank.</p><p><b>Shape Flow:</b> You can direct the flow of currents, increasing or decreasing the speed of water vessels by 20 percent for every 5 points your check exceeds Difficulty 10 (at Difficulty 35 you can stop water vessels entirely or double their speed).</p><p><b>Lower Water:</b> Waters lower by as much as 1 foot for every point your Water Shaping check exceeds Difficulty 10. The water lowers within an area with a 10-foot radius per power rank. In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as an ocean, this power creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward, putting them at risk and making them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration.</p><p><b>Raise Water:</b> Waters rise by as much as 1 foot for every point your Water Shaping check exceeds Difficulty 10. The water rises within an area with a 10-foot radius per power rank. Boats raised in this way slide down the sides of the watery hump created. If the area includes riverbanks, a beach, or other nearby land, the water can spill over onto dry land, causing floods.||Water Shaping is a standard action.|
Weather Shaping|Fatiguing||||<a href="Powers.php?Name=Water%20Shaping">Water Shaping</a> and <a href="Powers.php?Name=Wind%20Shaping">Wind Shaping</a>|You can shape the complex forces controlling the weather. More than just commanding the winds, you can change the weather to suit your will. A use of Weather Shaping affects an area with a diameter in miles equal to your power ranks, centered on you.</p><p>It takes (30 - power bonus) minutes for the effects of Weather Shaping to manifest, with a minimum of one round (at power bonus +30). You can call forth weather appropriate to the climate and season of the area you are in.</p><table width="500px"><th>Season</th><th>Possible Weather</th><tr class="odd-row"><td>Spring</td><td>Tornado, thunderstorm, sleet storm, or hot weather</td></tr><tr><td>Summer</td><td>Torrential rain, heat wave, or hailstorm</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td>Autumn</td><td>Hot or cold weather, fog, or sleet</td></tr><tr><td>Winter</td><td>Frigid cold, blizzard, or thaw</td></tr><tr class="odd-row"><td>Late winter</td><td>Hurricane-force winds or early spring (coastal area)</td></tr></table><p>You control the general tendencies of the weather, such as the direction and intensity of the wind. You cannot control specific effects of the weather--where lightning strikes, for example, or the exact path of a tornado. The weather continues as you left it for up to a number of hours equal to your power rank, or until you use a standard action to designate a new weather condition (which fully manifests 30 - power bonus minutes later). Weather Shaping can do away with weather conditions (naturally occurring or otherwise) as well as create them.|
Wind Shaping|Fatiguing|Maintenance||||You can shape and direct the wind. You can make the wind blow in a certain direction and change its speed. The new wind direction and speed last as long as you choose to maintain them. Changing them requires another use of this power. You can affect the winds in a 20-foot radius per power rank. You can create an area of calm air, up to 80 feet in diameter, at the center of the winds, if you wish, and you can limit the winds to an area less than the maximum for your power ranks.</p><p><b>Wind Direction:</b> You may choose one of four basic wind patterns to function over the area.</p><ol><li>A downdraft blows in all directions, from the center outward.</li><li>An updraft blows from all directions, from the outer edges toward the center.</li><li>A rotation causes winds to circle the center (clockwise or counterclockwise, as you wish).</li><li>A blast causes the winds to blow in one direction across the entire area, from one side to the other.</li></ol><p><b>Wind Speed:</b> With a Wind Shaping check, you can increase or decrease the wind's speed by one level for every 5 points you exceed Difficulty 10. Each round, on your turn, anyone in the area must make a Fortitude save or suffer the effects of the current wind speed. There are seven wind speed levels:</p><ul><li><i>Light Wind:</i> A gentle breeze, having no game effect.</li><li><i>Moderate Wind:</i> A steady wind with a 50 percent chance of extinguishing small, unprotected flames, such as candles. </li><li><i>Strong Wind:</i> Gusts that automatically extinguish unprotected flames (candles, torches, and the like). Such gusts impose a -2 penalty on ranged attack rolls and <a href="Skills.php?Name=Notice">Notice</a> checks for sounds. Strong winds knock down Tiny and smaller creatures. Flying creatures are blown backwards a short distance. A strong wind can speed or slow sailing vessels by 50 percent. </li><li><i>Severe Wind:</i> In addition to automatically extinguishing any unprotected flames, winds of this magnitude cause protected flames (such as in lanterns) to dance wildly and have a 50 percent chance of extinguishing them. Ranged weapon attacks and <a href="Skills.php?Name=Notice">Notice</a> checks are at a -4 penalty. Severe winds blow Tiny and smaller creatures back a short distance and knock down Small creatures. Medium creatures are unable to move forward against the force of the wind. </li><li><i>Windstorm:</i> Powerful enough to bring down branches, if not whole trees, windstorms automatically extinguish unprotected flames and have a 75 percent chance of blowing out protected ones. Ranged weapon attacks are impossible, and even siege weapons have a -4 penalty on attack rolls. <a href="Skills.php?Name=Notice">Notice</a> checks to listen are at a -8 penalty due to the howling wind. Windstorms blow away Small and smaller creatures, knock down Medium ones, and check the forward movement of Large creatures.</li><li><i>Hurricane-Force Wind:</i> All flames are extinguished. Ranged attacks are impossible (except with siege weapons, which have a -8 penalty on attack rolls). <a href="Skills.php?Name=Notice">Notice</a> checks to listen are impossible; all anyone can hear is the roaring of the wind. Hurricane-force winds often fell trees. These winds blow away Medium and smaller creatures, knock down Large ones, and check Huge creatures. </li><li><i>Tornado:</i> All flames are extinguished. All ranged attacks are impossible (even with siege weapons), as are <a href="Skills.php?Name=Notice">Notice</a> checks to hear anything. Instead of being blown away, Large and smaller creatures who fail their Fortitude saves are sucked toward the tornado. Those who come in contact with the actual funnel cloud are picked up and whirled around for 1-10 rounds (d20/2), taking +12 damage per round, before being violently expelled (falling damage may also apply). Huge creatures are knocked down, and Gargantuan creatures are checked and unable to move forward. While a tornado's rotational speed can be as great as 300 miles per hour, the funnel itself moves forward at an average of 30 miles per hour (roughly 250 feet per round). A tornado uproots trees, destroys buildings, and causes other similar forms of devastation.</li></ul>||Wind Shaping is a full-round action.|
