He has a 50% chance to miss in combat, cannot use <a href="Combat.php#Dodge">Dodge</a> or <a href="Combat.php#Parry">Parry</a>, and suffers an additional -2 modifier to <a href="Combat.php#BaseDefense">Defense</a>. He moves at half speed and suffers a -4 penalty on most <a href="Skills.php?Ability=Str">Strength</a> and <a href="Skills.php?Ability=Dex">Dexterity-based skill checks</a>.

Dead|The character is dead. A dead body generally starts to decay, but effects allowing a character to come back from death restore the body to full health or to its condition immediately prior to death. Either way, characters that have come back from the dead needn't worry about rigor mortis, decomposition, and other similar sorts of unpleasantness.|

For that round, they can take no actions other than reactions, and cannot use <a href="Combat.php#Dodge">Dodge</a> or <a href="Combat.php#Parry">Parry</a>. The character can use a <a href="BasicsConviction.php">Conviction point</a> to ignore this limitation. In the following rounds, disabled characters can only take a single move action. If a disabled character takes a standard action or a second move action, he falls <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Unconscious">unconscious</a> and begins <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Dying">dying</a> on the following round. The same happens when he performs any other strenuous action. Strenuous actions include moving all out, attacking, or using any ability requiring physical exertion or mental concentration.</p><p>A disabled character takes a -2 penalty on all checks, attack rolls and saving throws.</p><p>A character can use a <a href="BasicsConviction.php">Conviction point</a> to act normally for one round, thereby able to take two actions in a round, including move and standard actions, and to ignore the -2 penalty.</p><p>Unlike healthy characters, characters who are disabled can spend any number of <a href="BasicsConviction.php">Conviction points</a> in one round.|
Dying|A dying character is <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Unconscious">unconscious</a> and near death. Upon gaining this condition, the character must immediately make a Constitution check (Difficulty 10) at the beginning of each round. On a failed check, the character dies. On a successful check, the character lives for another round (and must make a check the following round). If the check succeeds by 10 or more (Difficulty 20), the character's condition becomes <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Disabled">disabled</a> and <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Unconscious">unconscious</a>.|
Entangled|An entangled character suffers a -2 penalty to effective Dexterity. If the bonds are anchored to an immobile object, the entangled character cannot move. Otherwise, he can move at half speed, but can't <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Move%20All%20Out">move all out</a> or <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Charge">charge</a>. An already entangled character that is entangled again becomes <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Helpless">helpless</a>.|
Fascinated|A fascinated character has been entranced by an effect. They stand or sit, taking no actions other than to pay attention to the fascinating effect, for as long as the effect lasts. The character takes a -4 penalty on checks made as reactions, such as <a href="Skills.php?Name=Notice">Notice</a> checks. Any potential threat allows the fascinated character a new saving throw or resistance check to overcome the fascination. Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon or aiming an attack at the fascinated character, automatically breaks the fascination. An ally can shake a fascinated character free of the effect with an aid action.|
Flat-Footed|A character who has not yet acted during a combat is flat-footed, not yet reacting to the situation. A flat-footed character is unable to use either his <a href="Combat.php#Dodge">Dodge</a> or <a href="Combat.php#Parry">Parry</a>.|

Helpless|Sleeping, bound, <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Paralyzed">paralyzed</a> or <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Unconscious">unconscious</a> characters are helpless. Enemies can make advantageous attacks against helpless characters, or even deliver a coup de grace. A melee attack against a helpless character is at a +4 bonus on the attack roll (equivalent to attacking a prone target). A ranged attack gets no special bonus. A helpless character's <a href="Combat.php#BaseDefense">Defense</a> score is 5, the same as an inanimate object. Helpless creatures cannot move or use their <a href="Combat.php#Dodge">Dodge</a> or <a href="Combat.php#Parry">Parry</a>.|

A pinned creature can take verbal and mental actions, but cannot cast any spells that require a somatic or material component. A pinned creature that attempts to use a <a href="Powers.php">supernatural power</a> must make a <a href="Skills.php?Name=Concentration">Concentration check</a> (Difficulty 10 + the power's rank) or the power fails to manifest.
