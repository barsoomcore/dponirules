Name|Condition|
Ability Damaged|The character has temporarily lost 1 or more ability score points. Lost ability score points return at a rate of 1 per day.|
Ability Drained|The character has permanently lost 1 or more ability score points. Points lost to ability drain do not recover.|
Blinded|The character cannot see at all, and thus everything has total visual concealment from him. He has a 50% chance to miss in combat, cannot use <a href="Combat.php#Dodge">Dodge</a> or <a href="Combat.php#Parry">Parry</a>, and suffers an additional -2 modifier to <a href="Combat.php#BaseDefense">Defense</a>. He moves at half speed and suffers a -4 penalty on most <a href="Skills.php?Ability=Str">Strength</a> and <a href="Skills.php?Ability=Dex">Dexterity-based skill checks</a>. He cannot make <a href="Skills.php?Name=Notice">Notice (spot) skill checks</a> or perform any other activity (such as reading) requiring vision.|
Bruised|The character has suffered some minor damage, but takes no ill effects.|
Dazed|A dazed character loses one full-round action after suffering a dazed result; they can take no actions, but retain their normal <a href="Combat.php#BaseDefense">Defense</a>, and can still use <a href="Combat.php#Dodge">Dodge</a> or <a href="Combat.php#Parry">Parry</a>. The following round, they can act normally. The character can use a <a href="BasicsConviction.php">Conviction point</a> to avoid the loss of a full-round action.|
Dazzled|Unable to see well because of overstimulation of the eyes (sudden bright light, etc). A dazzled character suffers a -1 on <a href="Combat.php#AttackBonus">attack rolls</a> and <a href="Combat.php#ManeuverBonus">maneuver rolls</a>, as well as <a href="Skills.php?Name=Notice">Notice</a> and <a href="Skills.php?Name=Search">Search</a> checks.|
Dead|The character is dead. A dead body generally starts to decay, but effects allowing a character to come back from death restore the body to full health or to its condition immediately prior to death. Either way, characters that have come back from the dead needn't worry about rigor mortis, decomposition, and other similar sorts of unpleasantness.|
Deafened|A deafened character cannot hear and suffers a -4 penalty to <a href="CombatInitiative.php">initiative checks</a>. He cannot make <a href="Skills.php?Name=Notice">Notice</a> (listen) checks.|
Debilitated|The character has one or more <a href="BasicsAbilities.php">ability scores</a> lowered below -5. A character with debilitated Strength falls prone and is <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Helpless">helpless</a>. A character with debilitated Dexterity is <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Paralyzed">paralyzed</a>. A character with debilitated Constitution is <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Dying">dying</a>. A character with debilitated Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is <a href="PlayingConditions.php?name=Unconscious">unconscious</a>.|
Disabled|Disabled characters are conscious and able to act, but are badly injured. They are <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Stunned">stunned</a> for one full round after suffering a disabled result. For that round, they can take no actions other than reactions, cannot use <a href="Combat.php#Dodge">Dodge</a> or <a href="Combat.php#Parry">Parry</a>, and have a -2 penalty to <a href="Combat.php#BaseDefense">Defense</a>. The -2 penalty to <a href="Combat.php#BaseDefense">Defense</a> does not stack with the penalty for being <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Wounded">wounded</a> or <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Staggered">staggered</a>.  The character can use a <a href="BasicsConviction.php">Conviction point</a> to remove the effect of the <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Stunned">stunned</a> condition. In the following rounds, disabled characters can only take a single move action. If a disabled character takes a standard action or a second move action, he falls <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Unconscious">unconscious</a> and begins <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Dying">dying</a> on the following round. The same happens when he performs any other strenuous action. Strenuous actions include moving all out, attacking, or using any ability requiring physical exertion or mental concentration. A character can use a <a href="BasicsConviction.php">Conviction point</a> to act normally for one round.</p><p>Unlike healthy characters, characters who are disabled can spend any number of <a href="BasicsConviction.php">Conviction points</a> in one round.|
Dying|A dying character is <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Unconscious">unconscious</a> and near death. Upon gaining this condition, the character must immediately make a Constitution check (Difficulty 10) at the beginning of each round. On a failed check, the character dies. On a successful check, the character lives for another round (and must make a check the following round). If the check succeeds by 10 or more (Difficulty 20), the character's condition becomes <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Disabled">disabled</a> and <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Unconscious">unconscious</a>.|
Entangled|An entangled character suffers a -2 penalty to effective Dexterity. If the bonds are anchored to an immobile object, the entangled character cannot move. Otherwise, he can move at half speed, but can't <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Move%20All%20Out">move all out</a> or <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Charge">charge</a>. An already entangled character that is entangled again becomes <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Helpless">helpless</a>.|
Exhausted|Exhausted characters are near collapse. They move at half normal speed and suffer a -3 penalty to effective Strength and Dexterity. An exhausted character suffering another fatigue result falls <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Unconscious">unconscious</a> (and must recover from it normally).|
Fascinated|A fascinated character has been entranced by an effect. They stand or sit, taking no actions other than to pay attention to the fascinating effect, for as long as the effect lasts. The character takes a -4 penalty on checks made as reactions, such as <a href="Skills.php?Name=Notice">Notice</a> checks. Any potential threat allows the fascinated character a new saving throw or resistance check to overcome the fascination. Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon or aiming an attack at the fascinated character, automatically breaks the fascination. An ally can shake a fascinated character free of the effect with an aid action.|
Fatigued|Fatigued characters cannot move all out or charge and suffer a -2 penalty to effective Strength and Dexterity. A fatigued character who does something else that would normally cause fatigue becomes <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Exhausted">exhausted</a>.|
Flat-Footed|A character who has not yet acted during a combat is flat-footed, not yet reacting to the situation. A flat-footed character is unable to use either his <a href="Combat.php#Dodge">Dodge</a> or <a href="Combat.php#Parry">Parry</a>.|
Frightened|A frightened character tries to flee from the source of the fear as quickly as possible. If unable to flee, the character is <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Shaken">shaken</a>.|
Grappled|A grappled creature is being restrained by another creature, trap, or effect. Grappled creatures cannot move or use their <a href="Combat.php#Dodge">Dodge</a> or <a href="Combat.php#Parry">Parry</a>. A grappled creature also takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls and combat maneuver rolls, except those made to grapple or escape a grapple. In addition, grappled creatures can take no action that requires two hands to perform. A grappled character that attempts to use a <a href="Powers.php">supernatural power</a> must make a <a href="Skills.php?Name=Concentration">Concentration</a> check (Difficulty 10 + the power's rank) or the power fails to manifest.|
Helpless|Sleeping, bound, <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Paralyzed">paralyzed</a> or <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Unconscious">unconscious</a> characters are helpless. Enemies can make advantageous attacks against helpless characters, or even deliver a coup de grace. A melee attack against a helpless character is at a +4 bonus on the attack roll (equivalent to attacking a prone target). A ranged attack gets no special bonus. A helpless character's <a href="Combat.php#BaseDefense">Defense</a> score is 5, the same as an inanimate object. Helpless creatures cannot move or use their <a href="Combat.php#Dodge">Dodge</a> or <a href="Combat.php#Parry">Parry</a>.|
Hurt|The character has suffered minor damage, but takes no ill effects.|
Invisible|An invisible character is virtually undetectable.

A pinned character also takes an additional -4 penalty to his Defense. A pinned creature is limited in the actions that it can take. A pinned creature can always attempt to free itself, usually through a <a href="Combat.php#ManeuverBonus">combat maneuver check</a> or <a href="Skills.php?Name=Escape%20Artist">Escape Artist</a> check. A pinned creature can take verbal and mental actions, but cannot cast any spells that require a somatic or material component. A pinned creature that attempts to use a <a href="Powers.php">supernatural power</a> must make a <a href="Skills.php?Name=Concentration">Concentration check</a> (Difficulty 10 + the power's rank) or the power fails to manifest.

During this round they can take no actions other than reactions, cannot use <a href="Combat.php#Dodge">Dodge</a> or <a href="Combat.php#Parry">Parry</a>, and have a -2 penalty to their <a href="Combat.php#BaseDefense">base Defense</a>.
