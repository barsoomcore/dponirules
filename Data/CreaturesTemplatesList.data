Against corporeal creatures, a ghost usually cannot deal physical damage at all. However, the ghost can use its special attacks, if any, when it manifests. A ghost gains a bonus to <a href="Combat.php#BaseDefense">defense</a> equal to its Charisma or +1, whichever is higher.||A ghost retains all the traits of the base creature, although those relying on physical contact do not affect corporeal creatures. The ghost also gains the manifestation, rejuvenation and unnatural aura traits and one or more other qualities described below. A ghost may also have supernatural <a href="Powers.php">powers</a> unique to it. The save Difficulty of a ghost's qualities is 10 + 1/2 the ghost's level (round down) + the ghost's Charisma, unless otherwise noted.</p><p><i>Manifestation:</i> Every ghost has this ability. A ghost dwells in the misty border realm between life and death and, as such, cannot affect or be affected by anything in the living world. When a ghost manifests, it partly enters the living world, becoming visible but incorporeal. When a ghost manifests, it can use any powers it possesses on material targets, provided they do not require physical contact. Only other incorporeal creatures, supernatural weapons, or powers can harm a manifested ghost. A manifested ghost can pass through solid objects at will. A manifested ghost always moves silently.</p><p><i>Rejuvenation:</i> It's difficult to destroy a ghost through simple combat. The destroyed spirit restores itself within eight days. A ghost that would otherwise be destroyed returns to its old haunts with a successful level check (1d20 + ghost's Charisma) against Difficulty 16. As a rule, the only way to get rid of a ghost permanently is to determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from moving on. The exact means varies with each ghost and may require a good deal of research</p><p><i>Unnatural Aura:</i> Animals, whether wild or domesticated, can sense the unnatural presence of the ghost at a distance of 30 feet. They do not willingly approach nearer than that and panic if forced to do so; they remain panicked as long as they are within that range.</p><p>All ghosts have one to three of the other traits described following.</p><ul style="margin-top:0.5em"><li><i>Ability Damage:</i> The ghost deals <a href="CreaturesTraits.php?Name=Ability%20Score%20Loss">ability damage</a> with its incorporeal touch.

The ability affected by this trait is given in the ghost's description.</li><li><i>Ability Drain:</i> The ghost deals <a href="CreaturesTraits.php?Name=Ability%20Score%20Loss">ability drain</a> with its incorporeal touch. The amount of <a href="CreaturesTraits.php?Name=Ability%20Score%20Loss">ability drain</a> is usually no greater than 2 points per touch. Its opponent is allowed a Fortitude save to negate the <a href="CreaturesTraits.php?Name=Ability%20Score%20Loss">ability drain</a>. On each such successful attack, the ghost gains an extra recovery check with a +5 bonus.</li><li><i>Chill Touch:</i> The ghost deals cold damage with its incorporeal touch. The damage is equal to the ghost's level.</li><li><i>Create Spawn:</i> A creature killed by the ghost's natural attacks rises from the dead as a similar ghost within 3 rounds. A spawn is under the command of the ghost that created it.</li><li><i>Drain Vitality:</i> The ghost can use the <a href="Powers.php?Name=Pressure%Points">Pressure Points</a> power with its incorporeal touch.</li><li><i>Frightful Moan:</i> The ghost can emit a frightful moan like the <i>fear</i> effect of the <a href="Powers.php?Name=Heart%20Shaping">Heart Shaping</a> power. Doing so causes the ghost no fatigue.</li><li><i>Horrific Appearance:</i> Any living creature within 60 feet that sees the ghost must succeed on a Fortitude save or immediately take 1 point of damage to all physical ability scores. A creature successfully saving against this effect is immune to the same ghost's horrific appearance for 24 hours.</li><li><i>Malevolence:</i> Once per round, the ghost can merge its incorporeal form with a living creature by touch. The target can resist the attack with a successful Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same ghost's malevolence for 24 hours, and the ghost cannot enter the target's space. If the save fails, the ghost vanishes into the target's body and controls it like a use of the <a href="Powers.php?Name=Dominate">Dominate</a> power.</li><li><i>Move Object:</i> The ghost can use the <a href="Powers.php?Name=Move%20Object">Move Object</a> power, even while incorporeal.</li><li><i>Sunlight Powerlessness:</i> this ghost is powerless in natural sunlight and flees from it. A ghost caught in sunlight cannot attack and can only take a single <a href="CombatActions.php?Time=Move">move</a> or <a href="CombatActions.php?Time=Standard">standard</a> action per round. It cannot move and attack in the same round unless it charges.</li></ul>|A ghosts natural armor bonus to Toughness is the same as the base creature's but applies only to incorporeal attacks. When the ghost manifests, its natural armor bonus is +0.| Ghosts are the spectral remnants of intelligent beings who, for one reason or another, cannot remain at rest.

On that night, the afflicted character involuntarily assumes animal form and forgets his or her own identity, temporarily becoming a Narrator character. The character remains in animal form, acting as the animal (in a particularly hungry and vicious mood) would, until the next dawn. The character remembers nothing about the entire episode (or subsequent episodes) unless he succeeds on a Dificulty 15 Wisdom check, in which case he becomes aware of his lycanthropic condition.</p><p>Thereafter, the character is subject to involuntary transformation under the full moon and whenever damaged in combat. He or she feels an overwhelming rage building up and must succeed on a <a href="SkillsControlShape.php">Control Shape</a> check to resist changing into animal form. Any player character not yet aware of his or her lycanthropic condition temporarily becomes a Narrator character during an involuntary change, and acts according to the nature his or her animal form.</p><p>A character with awareness of his condition retains his identity and does not lose control of his actions if he changes. However, each time he changes to his animal form, he must make a Will save (Difficulty 15 + number of times he has been in animal form) or permanently assume an animal-like mentality, seeking to satisfy his predatory hunger on human beings.</p><p>Once a character becomes aware of his affliction, he can now voluntarily attempt to change to animal or hybrid form, using the appropriate <a href="SkillsControlShape.php">Control Shape</a> check Difficulty. An attempt is a standard action and can be made each round. Any voluntary change to animal or hybrid form immediately and permanently changes the character's alignment to that of the appropriate lycanthrope.</p><p><i>Changing Form:</i> Changing form is a standard action. If the change is involuntary, the character performs the change on his next turn following the triggering event. Changing to animal or hybrid form ruins the character's armor and clothing (including any items worn) if the new form is larger than the character's natural form; carried items are simply dropped. Characters can hastily doff clothing while changing, but not armor. An afflicted character who is not aware of his condition remains in animal form until the next dawn. An afflicted character who is aware of his or her condition (see above) can try to resume humanoid form following a change (voluntary or involuntary) with a <a href="SkillsControlShape.php">Control Shape</a> check, but if he fails his check, he remains in animal (or hybrid) form until the following dawn.</p><p><i>Curing Lycanthropy:</i> An afflicted character who eats a sprig of <a href="EquipmentPoisons.php">belladonna</a> (also called wolfsbane) within 1 hour of a lycanthrope's attack can attempt a Difficulty 20 Fortitude save to shake off the affliction. If a healer administers the herb, use the character's save bonus or the healer's <a href="Skills.php?Name=Medicine">Medicine</a> modifier, whichever is higher. The character gets only one chance, no matter how much belladonna is consumed. The belladonna must be reasonably fresh (picked within the last week).</p><p>However, fresh or not, belladonna is toxic.
