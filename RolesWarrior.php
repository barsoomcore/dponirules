<p>Nimble, dashing rogues or relentless killing machines, warriors abound throughout the islands of the Dino-Pirates. No pirate ship can expect to win many prizes without some stout hearts and stouter arms, nor will a ninja clan thrive without swords wielded with skill and strength. Imperial Marines pride themselves on their discipline and skill at arms, and many native nations put their youth through punishing training in order to field armies of steel-eyed warriors.</p>
<p>All these characters can be best represented as warriors. Not only the strong doughty types, but acrobatic swashbucklers and deadly ninja assassins are all examples of the warrior role.</p>

<h2>Warrior Traits</h2>
<p>Warriors have the following traits:</p>

<p><strong><a href="BasicsAbilities.php">Abilities</a>: </strong>Warriors prize physical abilities over mental ones. Strength is important in striking a powerful blow, and holding off enemies. Dexterity allows warriors to evade incoming attacks and gives them accuracy with their own. Constitution may be warriors' most important quality, granting them the endurance to sustain long marches and to fight on when others fall due to injury or fatigue.</p>
<p><strong>Determination (Core Ability): </strong>A warrior can spend a point of Conviction to immediately erase all bruised and hurt <a href="CombatDamage.php">damage</a> conditions.</p>
<p><strong><a href="Skills.php">Skills</a>:</strong> At character creation, choose any 4 + Intelligence score starting <a href="Skills.php">skills</a> (minimum 1 -- all starting skills come at 4 ranks). Warriors gain 4 + Int skill ranks per additional level (minimum of 1). Important <a href="Skills.php">skills</a> for warriors tend to be physical, such as <a href="Skills.php?Name=Climb">Climb</a>, <a href="Skills.php?Name=Jump">Jump</a> and <a href="Skills.php?Name=Swim">Swim</a>, but with rules such as <a href="CombatActions.php?Name=Feint">Feint</a> and <a href="BasicsStunts.php">Stunts</a>, interaction skills such as <a href="Skills.php?Name=Bluff">Bluff</a> or <a href="Skills.php?Name=Intimidate">Intimidate</a> can be potent weapons.</p>
<p><strong><a href="Feats.php">Feats</a>:</strong> At character creation, a warrior receives <a href="Feats.php?Name=Martial%20Weapon%20Training">Martial Weapon Training</a>, and 3 others from <a href="Feats.php?Type=General">General</a> or <a href="Feats.php?Type=Warrior">Warrior</a>. Warriors gain another feat from those lists each level.</p>
<p><strong><a href="BasicsSavingThrows.php">Saving Throws</a>:</strong> Warriors have good Fortitude saves and normal Reflex and Will saves. Warriors also gain a +2 bonus at character creation on their Fortitude saves.</p>
<p><strong><a href="Combat.php">Combat Bonus</a>:</strong> Warriors gain a combat bonus equal to their level.</p>
<p><strong><a href="Powers.php">Powers</a>: </strong>Warriors do not acquire supernatural <a href="Powers.php">powers</a>.</p>
