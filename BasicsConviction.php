<h1>CONVICTION POINTS</h1>
<p>Whether it's luck, talent, or sheer determination, heroes have something setting them apart from everyone else, allowing them to perform amazing deeds under the most difficult circumstances. In DPoNI, that something is Conviction. Spending a Conviction point can make the difference between success and failure.</p>

<h2>Gaining Conviction</h2>
<p>Characters start at first level with three Conviction points, and automatically gain another Conviction point every odd-numbered level thereafter. Characters cannot recover Conviction if they have at least the appropriate starting Conviction for their level.</p>

<h2>Using Conviction</h2>
<p>Unless otherwise noted, spending a Conviction point is a reaction, taking no time, and can be done at any time. You may spend only one Conviction point per round, unless you are <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Disabled">Disabled</a>. You can spend Conviction for any of the following:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Re-roll:</dt>
	<dd>One Conviction point spent allows you to re-roll any die roll you make and take the better of the two rolls. On a result of 1 through 10 on the second roll, add 10 to the result; an 11 or higher remains as-is (so the second roll is always a result of 11-20). You must spend the Conviction point to improve a roll before the Narrator announces the result of your roll.</dd>
	<dt>Surge:</dt>
	<dd>Gain an additional <a href="CombatActions.php?Time=Standard">standard</a> or <a href="CombatActions.php?Time=Move">move</a> action, before or after your normal actions for the round (your choice). Using this extra action does not change your place in the initiative order. You can use a standard action gained from a surge to start or complete a <a href="CombatActions.php?Time=Full">full round action</a> in conjunction with your normal actions for the round.</dd>
	<dt>Heroic feat:</dt>
	<dd>You can spend a Conviction point to gain the benefits of a <a href="Feats.php">feat</a> your hero doesn't already have for one round. You must be capable of acquiring the <a href="Feats.php">feat</a> normally, meaning it must be a <a href="Feats.php">feat</a> available to your role(s) and you must meet all the prerequisites. For <a href="Feats.php">feats</a> that can be acquired multiple times, you gain the benefit of one acquisition of the <a href="Feats.php">feat</a> by spending a Conviction point.</dd>
	<dt>Core Ability</dt>
	<dd>Each <a href="Roles.php">role</a> has a separate Core Ability that a character who takes that role at first level can activate with a Conviction point.</dd>
	<dt>Recover:</dt>
	<dd>You can spend a Conviction point to recover faster in a couple of ways. A Conviction point allows you to immediately shake off a <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Stunned">stunned</a> or <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Strained">strained</a> condition. Alternatively, you can use a Conviction point to gain an immediate recovery check for either <a href="CombatDamage.php#Recovery">Damage</a> or <a href="PlayingFatigue.php">Fatigue</a>. This check is made normally; the Conviction point just allows you to make it in addition to your normal recovery check. While <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Disabled">disabled</a>, you can spend a Conviction point to take a strenuous action for one round without your condition worsening to <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Dying">dying</a>.</dd>
	<dt>Escape death:</dt>
	<dd>Spending a Conviction point automatically stabilizes a <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Dying">dying</a> character (you or someone you are assisting); although, this doesn't protect the character from further damage.</dd>
	<dt>Exit A Scene</dt>
	<dd>You can spend a Conviction point to automatically <a href="BasicsTime.php#Exit">exit a Scene</a>. Another participant in the scene may spend a Conviction point to interfere with your exit, if they desire.</dd>
	<dt>Take Advantage of Another's Reputation:</dt>
	<dd>You can spend a Conviction point to gain a bonus against a target's interaction skills equal to the target's <a href="BasicsReputation.php">Reputation</a>. The target may spend a Conviction point to end this effect.</dd>
	<dt>Quotable Wit:</dt>
	<dd>Any time a player says something worthy of being quoted (usually because it reduces the GM to helpless tears of laughter), any player may spend a conviction point to designate that comment as "Quotable Wit". A piece of quotable wit grants a +2 bonus to any related situation in which it is used. A maximum of three pieces of quotable wit may be used in any game session. Likewise, each piece of quotable wit may only be used once, and only those who heard its original use may benefit. Note that your enemies may hi-jack your quotable wit for their own purposes; irony's a bitch sometimes.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Disabled and Conviction</h2>
<p>When characters are <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Disabled">disabled</a> they can draw upon their last amount of strength and deliver a heroic "final" effort that they would never be able to do under normal circumstances. When a character is <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Disabled">disabled</a>, they are not limited to spending one Conviction point per round. They may spend as many Conviction points as they like (although, of course, no more than they have), for any purposes they like. Of course, if a character uses a Conviction point to gain a Recovery check, and recovers from being <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Disabled">disabled</a>, the character can no longer spend any Conviction points that round.</p>
<p>All other conditions of being <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Disabled">disabled</a> still apply.</p>

<h2><a name="Recovery">Recovering Conviction</a></h2>
<p>Characters recover used Conviction when they act in accordance to their <a href="CharGen.php#Nature">Nature (their Virtue or their Vice)</a>. The GM decides when such an action is worthy of recovering a Conviction point.</p>
<p>In addition, characters can attempt to recover a point of used Conviction after any dramatic scene is completed. A dramatic scene is one in which any of the following is true:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The character spent at least one Conviction point.</li>
	<li>The Narrator spent at least on Conviction point.</li>
	<li>The character had no Conviction points left and the scene went into combat rounds (<a href="CombatInitiative.php">initiative</a> was rolled and at least two rounds were completed).</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to attempt to recover a point of used Conviction, the character must make a Charisma check against a Difficulty of 10.</p>

<p>Any time a character is knocked <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Unconscious">unconscious</a>, <a href="PlayingConditions.php?Name=Disabled">disabled</a> by their enemies, or is placed under mental control (such as with the <a href="Powers.php?Name=Dominate">Dominate</a> power) by an enemy, the character receives a point of Conviction. This Conviction may be received even if the character is currently at their normal maximum Conviction for their level.</p>

<h2>Conviction In Play</h2>
<p>There are a lot of ways to use Conviction. Don't expect to be able to remember them all. But whenever you get into trouble, or are stuck for ideas, or get really blown away by something cool or hilarious, review the list of Conviction uses and who knows? Maybe something will occur to you. As you play more, you'll get more used to all the ways in which Conviction can be useful.</p>
