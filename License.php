<h1>THANK YOU</h1>

<p>There's a lot here. The Open Gaming License made possible all sorts of contributions and combinations, and the outpouring of cool ideas has been pretty inspiring all around. Most of what makes up DINO-PIRATES OF NINJA ISLAND are rules I got from somewhere else, and I'm deeply grateful to everyone who decided to share their good ideas with the rest of us.</p>
<p>That said, some folks deserve shout-outs. First and foremost of course, Stephanie, who makes everything else possible. After her, JPL, since it was all his idea in the first place. Folks like Matt and Joshua and Erica and Ian and Garth who all talked it up and shared their big brains with me. The many and patient playtesters who joined in DINO-PIRATES sessions all across North America in just the right sort of spirit. Thanks especially to Kira and James and Stuart who all hosted DPoNI games in a very generous manner. And big thanks to everyone on the <a href="http://www.true20.com/forum/">True20 forums</a> and over at <a href="http://www.circvsmaximvs.com/forum.php">the Circvs</a> who offered myriad suggestions, inspirations and other thrills. Thanks, everyone.</p>

<p>All text on every page on this website that has the heading, "<em>This material is Open Game Content, and is licensed for public use under the terms of the Open Game License v1.0a,</em>" is open game content. This does NOT include the DINO-PIRATES OF NINJA ISLAND name and logo, the Scratch Factory name and logo, the graphic design of the site, the PHP code used to create the pages, and all images.
