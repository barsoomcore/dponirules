<p>Skilled in both <a href="Combat.php">combat</a> and stealth, many adventurers seem to defy categorization. They dabble in sorcerous arts but can handle themselves well in <a href="Combat.php">combat</a>, with deadly abilities enhanced by their mystic <a href="Skills.php">skills</a>. These folks are impossible to predict and thrive on their broad range of abilities.</p>

<h2>Generalist Traits</h2>
<p>Generalists have the following traits:</p>

<p><strong><a href="BasicsAbilities.php">Abilities</a>: </strong>With such a broad range of abilities, the generalists cannot put all their physical or mental eggs in one basket. A spread of ability scores is best for helping these heroes make full use of their <a href="Skills.php">skills</a> and <a href="Powers.php">powers</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Ultimate Trait (Core Ability):</strong> A generalist can choose (at character creation) any one ability score, skill, saving throw or power; when making a check using that trait, they can spend a point of <a href="BasicsConviction.php">Conviction</a> and automatically treat the die roll as a 20. This is not considered a "natural" 20, but otherwise works just like a die result of 20. Note that choosing an ability score does NOT affect skill checks made with that ability, only raw ability checks are able to automatically produce a 20 in that case.</p>

<p><strong><a href="Skills.php">Skills</a>:</strong> Choose 6 + Intelligence score starting <a href="Skills.php">skills</a> (minimum of 1 -- all starting skills come at 4 ranks). Generalists gain 6 + Int skill ranks per additional level (minimum of 1). Like experts, generalists may find any array of <a href="Skills.php">skills</a> helpful.</p>

<p><strong><a href="Feats.php">Feats</a>:</strong> At character creation, choose any 4 starting <a href="Feats.php">feats</a> from the <a href="Feats.php?Type=General">General</a> and <a href="Feats.php?Type=Expert">Expert</a> categories. Each level the generalist may choose another <a href="Feats.php">feat</a> from those same categories. A generalist may choose a power instead of a <a href="Feats.php">feat</a> (but only a power on their pre-defined list of ten <a href="Powers.php">powers</a>).</p>

<p><strong><a href="BasicsSavingThrows.php">Saving Throws</a>:</strong> Generalists vary in their Fortitude, Reflex, and Will save bonuses. Choose one of these three to be a good save and two to be normal, consulting the appropriate column on the table. At character creation, a generalist gains a +2 bonus on their good save. If you chose a good save previously as either an expert or a generalist, you must keep that same good save.</p>

<p><strong><a href="Combat.php">Combat Bonus</a>:</strong> Generalists gain a combat bonus equal to three-quarters their level, rounded down.</p>

<p><strong><a href="Powers.php">Powers</a>:</strong> Generalists can acquire a limited selection or supernatural <a href="Powers.php">powers</a>. They may choose a power in place of a <a href="Feats.php">feat</a>, either starting <a href="Feats.php">feats</a> or those gained from improving in level. Each time the generalist gains a level, they may choose either a power or a <a href="Feats.php">feat</a>. The <a href="Powers.php">powers</a> chosen must be drawn from the list of <a href="Powers.php">powers</a> below. Generalists may only aquire those <a href="Powers.php">powers</a>, whether at first level or as they gain levels.</p>

<p><em>Power Ranks</em>: A generalist has power ranks equal to half their level (rounded down), plus three.</p>

<p><em><a href="PowersPhilosophies.php">Philosophy</a>:</em> A generalist is restricted in the philosophies they can choose, depending on their background. A ninja generalist may only select the Ninja Mentalism philosophy. A Dino-Pirate generalist may only select the Heavenly Medicine or Shamanism philosophies. An Imperial generalist may select either the Imperial Sorcery or the Heavenly Medicine philosophies. A Native generalist may only select the Heavenly Medicine or Shamanism philosophies. Of course, a generalist does not have to select any philosophy at all, if so desired.</p>

<p><strong>Key Ability:</strong> When taking their first level in the generalist role, characters must choose which of their mental abiliies (Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma) will serve as their Key Ability. This is the ability that modifies their Power checks and the Difficulty of any saving throws made against their powers. The <a href="Powers.php">Powers section</a> has more details.</p>
