<h1>SAVING THROWS</h1>

<p>There are four types of saving throws in DPoNI: Fortitude, Reflex, Will and Toughness. Saving throws enable characters to avoid hazards such as injury, poison, falling, or having their senses overwhelmed by magic. A successful saving throw is one that meets or exceeds the hazard's Difficulty.</p>
<p>You can't ever take 5, 10 or 20 on a saving throw. You can't apply <a href="Basics.php#Challenges">Challenges</a> to a saving throw. Saving throws cannot benefit from another's aid. A natural 1 is not an automatic failure on a saving throw, nor is a natural 20 an automatic success. Some saving throws (Fortitude, Reflex and Will, to be precise) are, however, subject to <a href="BasicsStunts.php">Stunts</a>.</p>

<h2>Types of Saving Throws</h2>
<p>The four different kinds of saving throws are: </p>
<p><b>Fortitude:</b> These saves measure the character's ability to stand up to massive physical punishment or attacks against his or her vitality and health such as poison and paralysis. Apply the character's Constitution modifier to his or her Fortitude saving throws.</p>
<p><b>Reflex:</b> These saves test the character's ability to dodge massive attacks such as explosions or collapsing pits. (Often, when damage is inevitable, the character gets to make a Reflex save to take only half damage.) Apply the character's Dexterity modifier to his or her Reflex saving throws.</p>
<p><b>Will:</b> These saves reflect the character's resistance to mental influence and domination as well as to many magical effects. Apply the character's Wisdom modifier to his or her Will saving throws.</p>
<p><b>Toughness:</b> These saves measure the character's ability to avoid or absorb damage from blows that connect. Whenever a character is struck by an attack, he or she makes a Toughness save to determine how serious the damage is. A Toughness save bonus is equal to the character's Constitution, plus any modifiers they may have. Note that Toughness saves, unlike the other three, CANNOT have <a href="BasicsStunts.php">stunt bonuses</a> applied to them.</p>
