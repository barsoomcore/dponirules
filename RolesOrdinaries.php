<h1>ORDINARIES</h1>

<p>While important Narrator characters and antagonists will usually belong to one of the four heroic roles (<a href="RolesWarrior.php">Warrior</a>, <a href="RolesAdept.php">Adept</a>, <a href="RolesExpert.php">Expert</a>, and <a href="RolesGeneralist.php">Generalist</a>), most people in the world aren't heroic adventurers or devious villains. They're just ordinary people, going about their daily lives, with very little need for the skills and abilities of adventuring heroes. These characters are called ordinaries in DPoNI.</p>
<p>Ordinary is essentially a fifth role, in addition to <a href="RolesWarrior.php">Warrior</a>, <a href="RolesAdept.php">Adept</a>, <a href="RolesExpert.php">Expert</a>, and <a href="RolesGeneralist.php">Generalist</a>, but it is a role inferior to the other four in terms of abilities. Levels in ordinary grant only one thing: 4 starting <a href="Skills.php">skills</a> at 1st level and 4 additional skill ranks per level. Ordinaries do not gain <a href="Combat.php">combat</a> or <a href="BasicsSavingThrows.php">saving throw</a> bonuses, nor do they gain any <a href="Feats.php">feats</a> (either at 1st level or as they progress in level). The only difference between a 1st-level ordinary and a 20th-level ordinary is the number and rank of the character's skills. This is the case for most ordinary people: they learn and develop skills, but have little or no need to improve their ability to fight, avoid hazards, and so forth. If you can describe a Narrator character as an "ordinary (whatever)," odds are that character has the ordinary role.</p>
<p>Ordinaries also do not have or gain <a href="BasicsConviction.php">Conviction</a>, nor do they acquire <a href="BasicsReputation.php">Reputation</a>. They don't have the extraordinary drive and motivation of heroes and villains. They can (and sometimes do) use extra effort, but that is all.</p>
<p>Of course, ordinaries can be <a href="RolesAdvancement.php">mixed-role</a>. They gain all the benefits of their level in any other role(s), including <a href="BasicsConviction.php">Conviction</a> and <a href="BasicsReputation.php">Reputation</a>. A retired soldier turned shopkeeper, for example, might be a 2nd-level <a href="RolesWarrior.php">Warrior</a> from his early military training, but a 5th-level ordinary from his years of minding the store, which developed some of his skills (like Knowledge and Sense Motive) but not his military prowess. Likewise, a wily government functionary might mix levels of <a href="RolesExpert.php">Expert</a> and ordinary, just as a wise sage might mix levels of <a href="RolesAdept.php">Adept</a> and ordinary; possessing some skill with the supernatural, but primarily focusing on "book knowledge."</p>
<p>You can generally treat ordinaries as two levels lower than their actual level when comparing them to heroes. Ordinaries lack many of the usual benefits of their level, so they're no match for a character of one of the other three roles at the same level.</p>
